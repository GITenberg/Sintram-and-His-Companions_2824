    <h2>
      <a name="linkIntroduction" id="linkIntroduction">Introduction</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Four tales are, it is said, intended by the Author to be appropriate to
      the Four Seasons: the stern, grave &ldquo;Sintram&rdquo;, to winter; the tearful,
      smiling, fresh &ldquo;Undine&rdquo;, to Spring; the torrid deserts of the &ldquo;Two
      Captains&rdquo;, to summer; and the sunset gold of &ldquo;Aslauga&rsquo;s Knight&rdquo;, to
      autumn. Of these two are before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of these tales, as well as of many more, was Friedrich, Baron
      de la Motte Fouque, one of the foremost of the minstrels or tale-tellers
      of the realm of spiritual chivalry&mdash;the realm whither Arthur&rsquo;s
      knights departed when they &ldquo;took the Sancgreal&rsquo;s holy quest,&rdquo;&mdash;whence
      Spenser&rsquo;s Red Cross knight and his fellows came forth on their adventures,
      and in which the Knight of la Mancha believed, and endeavoured to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Motte Fouque derived his name and his title from the French Huguenot
      ancestry, who had fled on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. His
      Christian name was taken from his godfather, Frederick the Great, of whom
      his father was a faithful friend, without compromising his religious
      principles and practice. Friedrich was born at Brandenburg on February 12,
      1777, was educated by good parents at home, served in the Prussian army
      through disaster and success, took an enthusiastic part in the rising of
      his country against Napoleon, inditing as many battle-songs as Korner.
      When victory was achieved, he dedicated his sword in the church of
      Neunhausen where his estate lay. He lived there, with his beloved wife and
      his imagination, till his death in 1843.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time life was to him a poet&rsquo;s dream. He lived in a continual
      glamour of spiritual romance, bathing everything, from the old deities of
      the Valhalla down to the champions of German liberation, in an ideal glow
      of purity and nobleness, earnestly Christian throughout, even in his
      dealings with Northern mythology, for he saw Christ unconsciously shown in
      Baldur, and Satan in Loki.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he lived, felt, and believed what he wrote, and though his dramas and
      poems do not rise above fair mediocrity, and the great number of his prose
      stories are injured by a certain monotony, the charm of them is in their
      elevation of sentiment and the earnest faith pervading all. His knights
      might be Sir Galahad&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My strength is as the strength of ten,<br /> Because my heart is pure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evil comes to them as something to be conquered, generally as a form of
      magic enchantment, and his &ldquo;wondrous fair maidens&rdquo; are worthy of them. Yet
      there is adventure enough to afford much pleasure, and often we have a
      touch of true genius, which has given actual ideas to the world, and
      precious ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      This genius is especially traceable in his two masterpieces, Sintram and
      Undine. Sintram was inspired by Albert Durer&rsquo;s engraving of the &ldquo;Knight of
      Death,&rdquo; of which we give a presentation. It was sent to Fouque by his
      friend Edward Hitzig, with a request that he would compose a ballad on it.
      The date of the engraving is 1513, and we quote the description given by
      the late Rev. R. St. John Tyrwhitt, showing how differently it may be
      read.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram2.jpg" alt="sintram2" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some say it is the end of the strong wicked man, just overtaken by Death
      and Sin, whom he has served on earth. It is said that the tuft on the
      lance indicates his murderous character, being of such unusual size. You
      know the use of that appendage was to prevent blood running down from the
      spearhead to the hands. They also think that the object under the horse&rsquo;s
      off hind foot is a snare, into which the old oppressor is to fall
      instantly. The expression of the faces may be taken either way: both good
      men and bad may have hard, regular features; and both good men and bad
      would set their teeth grimly on seeing Death, with the sands of their life
      nearly run out. Some say they think the expression of Death gentle, or
      only admonitory (as the author of &ldquo;Sintram&rdquo;); and I have to thank the
      authoress of the &ldquo;Heir of Redclyffe&rdquo; for showing me a fine impression of
      the plate, where Death certainly had a not ungentle countenance&mdash;snakes
      and all. I think the shouldered lance, and quiet, firm seat on horseback,
      with gentle bearing on the curb-bit, indicate grave resolution in the
      rider, and that a robber knight would have his lance in rest; then there
      is the leafy crown on the horse&rsquo;s head; and the horse and dog move on so
      quietly, that I am inclined to hope the best for the Ritter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Musing on the mysterious engraving, Fouque saw in it the life-long
      companions of man, Death and Sin, whom he must defy in order to reach
      salvation; and out of that contemplation rose his wonderful romance, not
      exactly an allegory, where every circumstance can be fitted with an
      appropriate meaning, but with the sense of the struggle of life, with
      external temptation and hereditary inclination pervading all, while Grace
      and Prayer aid the effort. Folko and Gabrielle are revived from the Magic
      Ring, that Folko may by example and influence enhance all higher
      resolutions; while Gabrielle, in all unconscious innocence, awakes the
      passions, and thus makes the conquest the harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is within the bounds of possibility that the similarities of folk- lore
      may have brought to Fouque&rsquo;s knowledge the outline of the story which
      Scott tells us was the germ of &ldquo;Guy Mannering&rdquo;; where a boy, whose
      horoscope had been drawn by an astrologer, as likely to encounter peculiar
      trials at certain intervals, actually had, in his twenty-first year, a
      sort of visible encounter with the Tempter, and came off conqueror by his
      strong faith in the Bible. Sir Walter, between reverence and realism, only
      took the earlier part of the story, but Fouque gives us the positive
      struggle, and carries us along with the final victory and subsequent
      peace. His tale has had a remarkable power over the readers. We cannot but
      mention two remarkable instances at either end of the scale. Cardinal
      Newman, in his younger days, was so much overcome by it that he hurried
      out into the garden to read it alone, and returned with traces of emotion
      in his face. And when Charles Lowder read it to his East End boys, their
      whole minds seemed engrossed by it, and they even called certain spots
      after the places mentioned. Imagine the Rocks of the Moon in Ratcliff
      Highway!
    </p>
    <p>
      May we mention that Miss Christabel Coleridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waynflete&rdquo; brings
      something of the spirit and idea of &ldquo;Sintram&rdquo; into modern life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undine&rdquo; is a story of much lighter fancy, and full of a peculiar grace,
      though with a depth of melancholy that endears it. No doubt it was founded
      on the universal idea in folk-lore of the nixies or water-spirits, one of
      whom, in Norwegian legend, was seen weeping bitterly because of the want
      of a soul. Sometimes the nymph is a wicked siren like the Lorelei; but in
      many of these tales she weds an earthly lover, and deserts him after a
      time, sometimes on finding her diving cap, or her seal-skin garment, which
      restores her to her ocean kindred, sometimes on his intruding on her while
      she is under a periodical transformation, as with the fairy Melusine, more
      rarely if he becomes unfaithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a remarkable Cornish tale of a nymph or mermaiden, who thus
      vanished, leaving a daughter who loved to linger on the beach rather than
      sport with other children. By and by she had a lover, but no sooner did he
      show tokens of inconstancy, than the mother came up from the sea and put
      him to death, when the daughter pined away and died. Her name was Selina,
      which gives the tale a modern aspect, and makes us wonder if the old
      tradition can have been modified by some report of Undine&rsquo;s story.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an idea set forth by the Rosicrucians of spirits abiding in the
      elements, and as Undine represented the water influences, Fouque&rsquo;s wife,
      the Baroness Caroline, wrote a fairly pretty story on the sylphs of fire.
      But Undine&rsquo;s freakish playfulness and mischief as an elemental being, and
      her sweet patience when her soul is won, are quite original, and indeed we
      cannot help sharing, or at least understanding, Huldbrand&rsquo;s beginning to
      shrink from the unearthly creature to something of his own flesh and
      blood. He is altogether unworthy, and though in this tale there is far
      less of spiritual meaning than in Sintram, we cannot but see that Fouque&rsquo;s
      thought was that the grosser human nature is unable to appreciate what is
      absolutely pure and unearthly.

      CHAPTER 1
    </h3>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    <p>
      In the high castle of Drontheim many knights sat assembled to hold council
      for the weal of the realm; and joyously they caroused together till
      midnight around the huge stone table in the vaulted hall. A rising storm
      drove the snow wildly against the rattling windows; all the oak doors
      groaned, the massive locks shook, the castle-clock slowly and heavily
      struck the hour of one. Then a boy, pale as death, with disordered hair
      and closed eyes, rushed into the hall, uttering a wild scream of terror.
      He stopped beside the richly carved seat of the mighty Biorn, clung to the
      glittering knight with both his hands, and shrieked in a piercing voice,
      &ldquo;Knight and father! father and knight! Death and another are closely
      pursuing me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An awful stillness lay like ice on the whole assembly, save that the boy
      screamed ever the fearful words. But one of Biorn&rsquo;s numerous retainers, an
      old esquire, known by the name of Rolf the Good, advanced towards the
      terrified child, took him in his arms, and half chanted this prayer: &ldquo;O
      Father, help Thy servant! I believe, and yet I cannot believe.&rdquo; The boy,
      as if in a dream, at once loosened his hold of the knight; and the good
      Rolf bore him from the hall unresisting, yet still shedding hot tears and
      murmuring confused sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lords and knights looked at one another much amazed, until the mighty
      Biorn said, wildly and fiercely laughing, &ldquo;Marvel not at that strange boy.
      He is my only son; and has been thus since he was five years old: he is
      now twelve. I am therefore accustomed to see him so; though, at the first,
      I too was disquieted by it. The attack comes upon him only once in the
      year, and always at this same time. But forgive me for having spent so
      many words on my poor Sintram, and let us pass on to some worthier subject
      for our discourse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was silence for a while; then whisperingly and doubtfully
      single voices strove to renew their broken-off discourse, but without
      success. Two of the youngest and most joyous began a roundelay; but the
      storm howled and raged so wildly without, that this too was soon
      interrupted. And now they all sat silent and motionless in the lofty hall;
      the lamp flickered sadly under the vaulted roof; the whole party of
      knights looked like pale, lifeless images dressed up in gigantic armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arose the chaplain of the castle of Drontheim, the only priest among
      the knightly throng, and said, &ldquo;Dear Lord Biorn, our eyes and thoughts
      have all been directed to you and your son in a wonderful manner; but so
      it has been ordered by the providence of God. You perceive that we cannot
      withdraw them; and you would do well to tell us exactly what you know
      concerning the fearful state of the boy. Perchance, the solemn tale, which
      I expect from you, might do good to this disturbed assembly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn cast a look of displeasure on the priest, and answered, &ldquo;Sir
      chaplain, you have more share in the history than either you or I could
      desire. Excuse me, if I am unwilling to trouble these light- hearted
      warriors with so rueful a tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the chaplain approached nearer to the knight, and said, in a firm yet
      very mild tone, &ldquo;Dear lord, hitherto it rested with you alone to relate,
      or not to relate it; but now that you have so strangely hinted at the
      share which I have had in your son&rsquo;s calamity, I must positively demand
      that you will repeat word for word how everything came to pass. My honour
      will have it so, and that will weigh with you as much as with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In stern compliance Biorn bowed his haughty head, and began the following
      narration. &ldquo;This time seven years I was keeping the Christmas feast with
      my assembled followers. We have many venerable old customs which have
      descended to us by inheritance from our great forefathers; as, for
      instance, that of placing a gilded boar&rsquo;s head on the table, and making
      thereon knightly vows of daring and wondrous deeds. Our chaplain here, who
      used then frequently to visit me, was never a friend to keeping up such
      traditions of the ancient heathen world. Such men as he were not much in
      favour in those olden times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My excellent predecessors,&rdquo; interrupted the chaplain, &ldquo;belonged more to
      God than to the world, and with Him they were in favour. Thus they
      converted your ancestors; and if I can in like manner be of service to
      you, even your jeering will not vex me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With looks yet darker, and a somewhat angry shudder, the knight resumed:
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I know all your promises and threats of an invisible Power, and
      how they are meant persuade us to part more readily with whatever of this
      world&rsquo;s goods we may possess. Once, ah, truly, once I too had such!
      Strange!&mdash;Sometimes it seems to me as though ages had passed over
      since then, and as if I were alone the survivor, so fearfully has
      everything changed. But now I bethink me, that the greater part of this
      noble company knew me in my happiness, and have seen my wife, my lovely
      Verena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his hands on his eyes, and it seemed as though he wept. The
      storm had ceased; the soft light of the moon shone through the windows,
      and her beams played on his wild features. Suddenly he started up, so that
      his heavy armour rattled with a fearful sound, and he cried out in a
      thundering voice, &ldquo;Shall I turn monk, as she has become a nun? No, crafty
      priest; your webs are too thin to catch flies of my sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to do with webs,&rdquo; said the chaplain. &ldquo;In all openness and
      sincerity have I put heaven and hell before you during the space of six
      years; and you gave full consent to the step which the holy Verena took.
      But what all that has to do with your son&rsquo;s sufferings I know not, and I
      wait for your narration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may wait long enough,&rdquo; said Biorn, with a sneer. &ldquo;Sooner shall&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear not!&rdquo; said the chaplain in a loud commanding tone, and his eyes
      flashed almost fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurra!&rdquo; cried Biorn, in wild affright; &ldquo;hurra! Death and his companion
      are loose!&rdquo; and he dashed madly out of the chamber and down the steps. The
      rough and fearful notes of his horn were heard summoning his retainers;
      and presently afterwards the clatter of horses&rsquo; feet on the frozen
      court-yard gave token of their departure. The knights retired, silent and
      shuddering; while the chaplain remained alone at the huge stone table,
      praying.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 2
    </h3>
    <p>
      After some time the good Rolf returned with slow and soft steps, and
      started with surprise at finding the hall deserted. The chamber where he
      had been occupied in quieting and soothing the unhappy child was in so
      distant a part of the castle that he had heard nothing of the knight&rsquo;s
      hasty departure. The chaplain related to him all that had passed, and then
      said, &ldquo;But, my good Rolf, I much wish to ask you concerning those strange
      words with which you seemed to lull poor Sintram to rest. They sounded
      like sacred words, and no doubt they are; but I could not understand them.
      &lsquo;I believe, and yet I cannot believe.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reverend sir,&rdquo; answered Rolf, &ldquo;I remember that from my earliest years no
      history in the Gospels has taken such hold of me as that of the child
      possessed with a devil, which the disciples were not able to cast out; but
      when our Saviour came down from the mountain where He had been
      transfigured, He broke the bonds wherewith the evil spirit had held the
      miserable child bound. I always felt as if I must have known and loved
      that boy, and been his play-fellow in his happy days; and when I grew
      older, then the distress of the father on account of his lunatic son lay
      heavy at my heart. It must surely have all been a foreboding of our poor
      young Lord Sintram, whom I love as if he were my own child; and now the
      words of the weeping father in the Gospel often come into my mind,&mdash;&lsquo;Lord,
      I believe; help Thou my unbelief;&rsquo; and something similar I may very likely
      have repeated to-day as a chant or a prayer. Reverend father, when I
      consider how one dreadful imprecation of the father has kept its withering
      hold on the son, all seems dark before me; but, God be praised! my faith
      and my hope remain above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Rolf,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;I cannot clearly understand what you say
      about the unhappy Sintram; for I do not know when and how this affliction
      came upon him. If no oath or solemn promise bind you to secrecy, will you
      make known to me all that is connected with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly,&rdquo; replied Rolf. &ldquo;I have long desired to have an
      opportunity of so doing; but you have been almost always separated from
      us. I dare not now leave the sleeping boy any longer alone; and to-morrow,
      at the earliest dawn, I must take him to his father. Will you come with
      me, dear sir, to our poor Sintram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain at once took up the small lamp which Rolf had brought with
      him, and they set off together through the long vaulted passages. In the
      small distant chamber they found the poor boy fast asleep. The light of
      the lamp fell strangely on his very pale face. The chaplain stood gazing
      at him for some time, and at length said: &ldquo;Certainly from his birth his
      features were always sharp and strongly marked, but now they are almost
      fearfully so for such a child; and yet no one can help having a kindly
      feeling towards him, whether he will or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most true, dear sir,&rdquo; answered Rolf. And it was evident how his whole
      heart rejoiced at any word which betokened affection for his beloved young
      lord. Thereupon he placed the lamp where its light could not disturb the
      boy, and seating himself close by the priest, he began to speak in the
      following terms:&mdash;&ldquo;During that Christmas feast of which my lord was
      talking to you, he and his followers discoursed much concerning the German
      merchants, and the best means of keeping down the increasing pride and
      power of the trading-towns. At length Biorn laid his impious hand on the
      golden boar&rsquo;s head, and swore to put to death without mercy every German
      trader whom fate, in what way soever, might bring alive into his power.
      The gentle Verena turned pale, and would have interposed&mdash;but it was
      too late, the bloody word was uttered. And immediately afterwards, as
      though the great enemy of souls were determined at once to secure with
      fresh bonds the vassal thus devoted to him, a warder came into the hall to
      announce that two citizens of a trading-town in Germany, an old man and
      his son, had been shipwrecked on this coast, and were now within the
      gates, asking hospitality of the lord of the castle. The knight could not
      refrain from shuddering; but he thought himself bound by his rash vow and
      by that accursed heathenish golden boar. We, his retainers, were commanded
      to assemble in the castle-yard, armed with sharp spears, which were to be
      hurled at the defenceless strangers at the first signal made to us. For
      the first, and I trust the last time in my life, I said &lsquo;No&rsquo; to the
      commands of my lord; and that I said in a loud voice, and with the
      heartiest determination. The Almighty, who alone knows whom He will accept
      and whom He will reject, armed me with resolution and strength. And Biorn
      might perceive whence the refusal of his faithful old servant arose, and
      that it was worthy of respect. He said to me, half in anger and half in
      scorn: &lsquo;Go up to my wife&rsquo;s apartments; her attendants are running to and
      fro, perhaps she is ill. Go up, Rolf the Good, I say to thee, and so women
      shall be with women.&rsquo; I thought to myself, &lsquo;Jeer on, then;&rsquo; and I went
      silently the way that he had pointed out to me. On the stairs there met me
      two strange and right fearful beings, whom I had never seen before; and I
      know not how they got into the castle. One of them was a great tall man,
      frightfully pallid and thin; the other was a dwarf-like man, with a most
      hideous countenance and features. Indeed, when I collected my thoughts and
      looked carefully at him, it appeared to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Low moanings and convulsive movements of the boy here interrupted the
      narrative. Rolf and his chaplain hastened to his bedside, and perceived
      that his countenance wore an expression of fearful agony, and that he was
      struggling in vain to open his eyes. The priest made the Sign of the Cross
      over him, and immediately peace seemed to be restored, and his sleep again
      became quiet: they both returned softly to their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Rolf, &ldquo;that it will not do to describe more closely those
      two awful beings. Suffice it to say, that they went down into the
      court-yard, and that I proceeded to my lady&rsquo;s apartments. I found the
      gentle Verena almost fainting with terror and overwhelming anxiety, and I
      hastened to restore her with some of those remedies which I was able to
      apply by my skill, through God&rsquo;s gift and the healing virtues of herbs and
      minerals. But scarcely had she recovered her senses, when, with that calm
      holy power which, as you know, is hers, she desired me to conduct her down
      to the court-yard, saying that she must either put a stop to the fearful
      doings of this night, or herself fall a sacrifice. Our way took us by the
      little bed of the sleeping Sintram. Alas! hot tears fell from my eyes to
      see how evenly his gentle breath then came and went, and how sweetly he
      smiled in his peaceful slumbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man put his hands to his eyes, and wept bitterly; but soon he
      resumed his sad story. &ldquo;As we approached the lowest window of the
      staircase, we could hear distinctly the voice of the elder merchant; and
      on looking out, the light of the torches showed me his noble features, as
      well as the bright youthful countenance of his son. &lsquo;I take Almighty God
      to witness,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;that I had no evil thought against this house! But
      surely I must have fallen unawares amongst heathens; it cannot be that I
      am in a Christian knight&rsquo;s castle; and if you are indeed heathens, then
      kill us at once. And thou, my beloved son, be patient and of good courage;
      in heaven we shall learn wherefore it could not be otherwise.&rsquo; I thought I
      could see those two fearful ones amidst the throng of retainers. The pale
      one had a huge curved sword in his hand, the little one held a spear
      notched in a strange fashion. Verena tore open the window, and cried in
      silvery tones through the wild night, &lsquo;My dearest lord and husband, for
      the sake of your only child, have pity on those harmless men! Save them
      from death, and resist the temptation of the evil spirit.&rsquo; The knight
      answered in his fierce wrath&mdash;but I cannot repeat his words. He
      staked his child on the desperate cast; he called Death and the Devil to
      see that he kept his word:&mdash;but hush! the boy is again moaning. Let
      me bring the dark tale quickly to a close. Biorn commanded his followers
      to strike, casting on them those fierce looks which have gained him the
      title of Biorn of the Fiery Eyes; while at the same time the two frightful
      strangers bestirred themselves very busily. Then Verena called out, with
      piercing anguish, &lsquo;Help, O God, my Saviour!&rsquo; Those two dreadful figures
      disappeared; and the knight and his retainers, as if seized with
      blindness, rushed wildly one against the other, but without doing injury
      to themselves, or yet being able to strike the merchants, who ran so close
      a risk. They bowed reverently towards Verena, and with calm thanksgivings
      departed through the castle- gates, which at that moment had been burst
      open by a violent gust of wind, and now gave a free passage to any who
      would go forth. The lady and I were yet standing bewildered on the stairs,
      when I fancied I saw the two fearful forms glide close by me, but
      mist-like and unreal. Verena called to me: &lsquo;Rolf, did you see a tall pale
      man, and a little hideous one with him, pass just now up the staircase?&rsquo; I
      flew after them; and found, alas, the poor boy in the same state in which
      you saw him a few hours ago. Ever since, the attack has come on him
      regularly at this time, and he is in all respects fearfully changed. The
      lady of the castle did not fail to discern the avenging hand of Heaven in
      this calamity; and as the knight, her husband, instead of repenting, ever
      became more truly Biorn of the Fiery Eyes, she resolved, in the walls of a
      cloister, by unremitting prayer, to obtain mercy in time and eternity for
      herself and her unhappy child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rolf was silent; and the chaplain, after some thought, said: &ldquo;I now
      understand why, six years ago, Biorn confessed his guilt to me in general
      words, and consented that his wife should take the veil. Some faint
      compunction must then have stirred within him, and perhaps may stir him
      yet. At any rate it was impossible that so tender a flower as Verena could
      remain longer in so rough keeping. But who is there now to watch over and
      protect our poor Sintram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prayer of his mother,&rdquo; answered Rolf. &ldquo;Reverend sir, when the first
      dawn of day appears, as it does now, and when the morning breeze whispers
      through the glancing window, they ever bring to my mind the soft beaming
      eyes of my lady, and I again seem to hear the sweet tones of her voice.
      The holy Verena is, next to God, our chief aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let us add our devout supplications to the Lord,&rdquo; said the chaplain;
      and he and Rolf knelt in silent and earnest prayer by the bed of the pale
      sufferer, who began to smile in his dreams.

      CHAPTER 3
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rays of the sun shining brightly into the room awoke Sintram, and
      raising himself up, he looked angrily at the chaplain, and said, &ldquo;So there
      is a priest in the castle! And yet that accursed dream continues to
      torment me even in his very presence. Pretty priest he must be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; answered the chaplain in the mildest tone, &ldquo;I have prayed for
      thee most fervently, and I shall never cease doing so&mdash;but God alone
      is Almighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak very boldly to the son of the knight Biorn,&rdquo; cried Sintram.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My child!&rsquo; If those horrible dreams had not been again haunting me, you
      would make me laugh heartily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Lord Sintram,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;I am by no means surprised that
      you do not know me again; for in truth, neither do I know you again.&rdquo; And
      his eyes filled with tears as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Rolf looked sorrowfully in the boy&rsquo;s face, saying, &ldquo;Ah, my dear
      young master, you are so much better than you would make people believe.
      Why do you that? Your memory is so good, that you must surely recollect
      your kind old friend the chaplain, who used formerly to be constantly at
      the castle, and to bring you so many gifts&mdash; bright pictures of
      saints, and beautiful songs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that very well,&rdquo; replied Sintram thoughtfully. &ldquo;My sainted
      mother was alive in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our gracious lady is still living, God be praised,&rdquo; said the good Rolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does not live for us, poor sick creatures that we are!&rdquo; cried
      Sintram. &ldquo;And why will you not call her sainted? Surely she knows nothing
      about my dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she does know of them,&rdquo; said the chaplain; &ldquo;and she prays to God for
      you. But take heed, and restrain that wild, haughty temper of yours. It
      might, indeed, come to pass that she would know nothing about your dreams,
      and that would be if your soul were separated from your body; and then the
      holy angels also would cease to know anything of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram fell back on his bed as if thunderstruck; and Rolf said, with a
      gentle sigh, &ldquo;You should not speak so severely to my poor sick child,
      reverend sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy sat up, and with tearful eyes he turned caressingly towards the
      chaplain: &ldquo;Let him do as he pleases, you good, tender-hearted Rolf; he
      knows very well what he is about. Would you reprove him if I were slipping
      down a snow-cleft, and he caught me up roughly by the hair of my head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest looked tenderly at him, and would have spoken his holy
      thoughts, when Sintram suddenly sprang off the bed and asked after his
      father. As soon as he heard of the knight&rsquo;s departure, he would not remain
      another hour in the castle; and put aside the fears of the chaplain and
      the old esquire, lest a rapid journey should injure his hardly restored
      health, by saying to them, &ldquo;Believe me, reverend sir, and dear old Rolf,
      if I were not subject to these hideous dreams, there would not be a bolder
      youth in the whole world; and even as it is, I am not so far behind the
      very best. Besides, till another year has passed, my dreams are at an
      end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his somewhat imperious sign Rolf brought out the horses. The boy threw
      himself boldly into the saddle, and taking a courteous leave of the
      chaplain, he dashed along the frozen valley that lay between the snow-clad
      mountains. He had not ridden far, in company with his old attendant, when
      he heard a strange indistinct sound proceeding from a neighbouring cleft
      in the rock; it was partly like the clapper of a small mill, but mingled
      with that were hollow groans and other tones of distress. Thither they
      turned their horses, and a wonderful sight showed itself to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall man, deadly pale, in a pilgrim&rsquo;s garb, was striving with violent
      though unsuccessful efforts, to work his way out of the snow and to climb
      up the mountain; and thereby a quantity of bones, which were hanging
      loosely all about his garments, rattled one against the other, and caused
      the mysterious sound already mentioned. Rolf, much terrified, crossed
      himself, while the bold Sintram called out to the stranger, &ldquo;What art thou
      doing there? Give an account of thy solitary labours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live in death,&rdquo; replied that other one with a fearful grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose are those bones on thy clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are relics, young sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou a pilgrim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Restless, quietless, I wander up and down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must not perish here in the snow before my eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must come up and sit on my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will.&rdquo; And all at once he started up out of the snow with
      surprising strength and agility, and sat on the horse behind Sintram,
      clasping him tight in his long arms. The horse, startled by the rattling
      of the bones, and as if seized with madness, rushed away through the most
      trackless passes. The boy soon found himself alone with his strange
      companion; for Rolf, breathless with fear, spurred on his horse in vain,
      and remained far behind them. From a snowy precipice the horse slid,
      without falling, into a narrow gorge, somewhat indeed exhausted, yet
      continuing to snort and foam as before, and still unmastered by the boy.
      Yet his headlong course being now changed into a rough irregular trot,
      Sintram was able to breathe more freely, and to begin the following
      discourse with his unknown companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw thy garment closer around thee, thou pale man, so the bones will not
      rattle, and I shall be able to curb my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be of no avail, boy; it would be of no avail. The bones must
      rattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not clasp me so tight with thy long arms, they are so cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be helped, boy; it cannot be helped. Be content. For my long
      cold arms are not pressing yet on thy heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not breathe on me so with thy icy breath. All my strength is
      departing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must breathe, boy; I must breathe. But do not complain. I am not
      blowing thee away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strange dialogue here came to an end; for to Sintram&rsquo;s surprise he
      found himself on an open plain, over which the sun was shining brightly,
      and at no great distance before him he saw his father&rsquo;s castle. While he
      was thinking whether he might invite the unearthly pilgrim to rest there,
      this one put an end to his doubts by throwing himself suddenly off the
      horse, whose wild course was checked by the shock. Raising his forefinger,
      he said to the boy, &ldquo;I know old Biorn of the Fiery Eyes well; perhaps but
      too well. Commend me to him. It will not need to tell him my name; he will
      recognize me at the description.&rdquo; So saying, the ghastly stranger turned
      aside into a thick fir-wood, and disappeared rattling amongst the tangled
      branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and thoughtfully Sintram rode on towards his father&rsquo;s castle, his
      horse now again quiet and altogether exhausted. He scarcely knew how much
      he ought to relate of his wonderful journey, and he also felt oppressed
      with anxiety for the good Rolf, who had remained so far behind. He found
      himself at the castle-gate sooner than he had expected; the drawbridge was
      lowered, the doors were thrown open; an attendant led the youth into the
      great hall, where Biorn was sitting all alone at a huge table, with many
      flagons and glasses before him, and suits of armour ranged on either side
      of him. It was his daily custom, by way of company, to have the armour of
      his ancestors, with closed visors, placed all round the table at which he
      sat. The father and son began conversing as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Rolf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, father; he left me in the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will have Rolf shot if he cannot take better care than that of my only
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father, you will have your only child shot at the same time, for
      without Rolf I cannot live; and if even one single dart is aimed at him, I
      will be there to receive it, and to shield his true and faithful heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&mdash;Then Rolf shall not be shot, but he shall be driven from the
      castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, father, you will see me go away also; and I will give
      myself up to serve him in forests, in mountains, in caves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&mdash;Well, then, Rolf must remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I think, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you riding quite alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father; but with a strange pilgrim. He said that he knew you very
      well&mdash;perhaps too well.&rdquo; And thereupon Sintram began to relate and to
      describe all that had passed with the pale man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him also very well,&rdquo; said Biorn. &ldquo;He is half crazed and half wise,
      as we sometimes are astonished at seeing that people can be. But do thou,
      my boy, go to rest after thy wild journey. I give you my word that Rolf
      shall be kindly received if he arrive here; and that if he do not come
      soon, he shall be sought for in the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust to your word, father,&rdquo; said Sintram, half humble, half proud; and
      he did after the command of the grim lord of the castle.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 4
    </h3>
    <p>
      Towards evening Sintram awoke. He saw the good Rolf sitting at his
      bedside, and looked up in the old man&rsquo;s kind face with a smile of
      unusually innocent brightness. But soon again his dark brows were knit,
      and he asked, &ldquo;How did my father receive you, Rolf? Did he say a harsh
      word to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear young lord, he did not; indeed he did not speak to me at all.
      At first he looked very wrathful; but he checked himself, and ordered a
      servant to bring me food and wine to refresh me, and afterwards to take me
      to your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have kept his word better. But he is my father, and I must not
      judge him too hardly. I will now go down to the evening meal.&rdquo; So saying,
      he sprang up and threw on his furred mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Rolf stopped him, and said, entreatingly: &ldquo;My dear young master, you
      would do better to take your meal to-day alone here in your own apartment;
      for there is a guest with your father, in whose company I should be very
      sorry to see you. If you will remain here, I will entertain you with
      pleasant tales and songs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing in the world which I should like better, dear Rolf,&rdquo;
       answered Sintram; &ldquo;but it does not befit me to shun any man. Tell me, whom
      should I find with my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;you have already found him in the mountain.
      Formerly, when I used to ride about the country with Biorn, we often met
      with him, but I was forbidden to tell you anything about him; and this is
      the first time that he has ever come to the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The crazy pilgrim!&rdquo; replied Sintram; and he stood awhile in deep thought,
      as if considering the matter. At last, rousing himself, he said, &ldquo;Dear old
      friend, I would most willingly stay here this evening all alone with you
      and your stories and songs, and all the pilgrims in the world should not
      entice me from this quiet room. But one thing must be considered. I feel a
      kind of dread of that pale, tall man; and by such fears no knight&rsquo;s son
      can ever suffer himself to be overcome. So be not angry, dear Rolf, if I
      determine to go and look that strange palmer in the face.&rdquo; And he shut the
      door of the chamber behind him, and with firm and echoing steps proceeded
      to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim and the knight were sitting opposite to each other at the
      great table, on which many lights were burning; and it was fearful,
      amongst all the lifeless armour, to see those two tall grim men move, and
      eat, and drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the pilgrim looked up on the boy&rsquo;s entrance, Biorn said: &ldquo;You know him
      already: he is my only child, and fellow-traveller this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The palmer fixed an earnest look on Sintram, and answered, shaking his
      head, &ldquo;I know not what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the boy burst forth, impatiently, &ldquo;It must be confessed that you deal
      very unfairly by us! You say that you know my father but too much, and now
      it seems that you know me altogether too little. Look me in the face: who
      allowed you to ride on his horse, and in return had his good steed driven
      almost wild? Speak, if you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn smiled, shaking his head, but well pleased, as was his wont, with
      his son&rsquo;s wild behaviour; while the pilgrim shuddered as if terrified and
      overcome by some fearful irresistible power. At length, with a trembling
      voice, he said these words: &ldquo;Yes, yes, my dear young lord, you are surely
      quite right; you are perfectly right in everything which you may please to
      assert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the lord of the castle laughed aloud, and said: &ldquo;Why, thou strange
      pilgrim, what is become of all thy wonderfully fine speeches and warnings
      now? Has the boy all at once struck thee dumb and powerless? Beware, thou
      prophet-messenger, beware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the palmer cast a fearful look on Biorn, which seemed to quench the
      light of his fiery eyes, and said solemnly, in a thundering voice,
      &ldquo;Between me and thee, old man, the case stands quite otherwise. We have
      nothing to reproach each other with. And now suffer me to sing a song to
      you on the lute.&rdquo; He stretched out his hand, and took down from the wall a
      forgotten and half-strung lute, which was hanging there; and, with
      surprising skill and rapidity, having put it in a state fit for use, he
      struck some chords, and raised this song to the low melancholy tones of
      the instrument:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The flow&rsquo;ret was mine own, mine own,<br /> But I have lost its fragrance
      rare,<br /> And knightly name and freedom fair,<br /> Through sin, through
      sin alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flow&rsquo;ret was thine own, thine own,<br /> Why cast away what thou didst
      win?<br /> Thou knight no more, but slave of sin,<br /> Thou&rsquo;rt fearfully
      alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care!&rdquo; shouted he at the close in a pealing voice, as he pulled
      the strings so mightily that they all broke with a clanging wail, and a
      cloud of dust rose from the old lute, which spread round him like a mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram had been watching him narrowly whilst he was singing, and more and
      more did he feel convinced that it was impossible that this man and his
      fellow-traveller of the morning could be one and the same. Nay, the doubt
      rose to certainty, when the stranger again looked round at him with the
      same timid, anxious air, and with many excuses and low reverences hung the
      lute in its old place, and then ran out of the hall as if bewildered with
      terror, in strange contrast with the proud and stately bearing which he
      had shown to Biorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the boy were now directed to his father, and he saw that he
      had sunk back senseless in his seat, as if struck by a blow. Sintram&rsquo;s
      cries called Rolf and other attendants into the hall; and only by great
      labour did their united efforts awake the lord of the castle. His looks
      were still wild and disordered; but he allowed himself to be taken to
      rest, quiet and yielding.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 5
    </h3>
    <p>
      An illness followed this sudden attack; and during the course of it the
      stout old knight, in the midst of his delirious ravings, did not cease to
      affirm confidently that he must and should recover. He laughed proudly
      when his fever-fits came on, and rebuked them for daring to attack him so
      needlessly. Then he murmured to himself, &ldquo;That was not the right one yet;
      there must still be another one out in the cold mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Always at such words Sintram involuntarily shuddered; they seemed to
      strengthen his notion that he who had ridden with him, and he who had sat
      at table in the castle, were two quite distinct persons; and he knew not
      why, but this thought was inexpressibly awful to him. Biorn recovered, and
      appeared to have entirely forgotten his adventure with the palmer. He
      hunted in the mountains; he carried on his usual wild warfare with his
      neighbours; and Sintram, as he grew up, became his almost constant
      companion; whereby each year a fearful strength of body and spirit was
      unfolded in the youth. Every one trembled at the sight of his sharp pallid
      features, his dark rolling eyes, his tall, muscular, and somewhat lean
      form; and yet no one hated him&mdash;not even those whom he distressed or
      injured in his wildest humours. This might arise in part out of regard to
      old Rolf, who seldom left him for long, and who always held a softening
      influence over him; but also many of those who had known the Lady Verena
      while she still lived in the world affirmed that a faint reflection of her
      heavenly expression floated over the very unlike features of her son, and
      that by this their hearts were won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, just at the beginning of spring, Biorn and his son were hunting in
      the neighbourhood of the sea-coast, over a tract of country which did not
      belong to them; drawn thither less by the love of sport than by the wish
      of bidding defiance to a chieftain whom they detested, and thus exciting a
      feud. At that season of the year, when his winter dreams had just passed
      off, Sintram was always unusually fierce and disposed for warlike
      adventures. And this day he was enraged at the chieftain for not coming in
      arms from his castle to hinder their hunting; and he cursed, in the
      wildest words, his tame patience and love of peace. Just then one of his
      wild young companions rushed towards him, shouting joyfully: &ldquo;Be content
      my dear young lord! I will wager that all is coming about as we and you
      wish; for as I was pursuing a wounded deer down to the sea-shore, I saw a
      sail and a vessel filled with armed men making for the shore. Doubtless
      your enemy purposes to fall upon you from the coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram5.jpg" alt="sintram5" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Joyfully and secretly Sintram called all his followers together, being
      resolved this time to take the combat on himself alone, and then to rejoin
      his father, and astonish him with the sight of captured foes and other
      tokens of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters, thoroughly acquainted with every cliff and rock on the coast,
      hid themselves round the landing-place; and soon the strange vessel hove
      nearer with swelling sails, till at length it came to anchor, and its crew
      began to disembark in unsuspicious security. At the head of them appeared
      a knight of high degree, in blue steel armour richly inlaid with gold. His
      head was bare, for he carried his costly golden helmet hanging on his left
      arm. He looked royally around him; and his countenance, which dark brown
      locks shaded, was pleasant to behold; and a well-trimmed moustache fringed
      his mouth, from which, as he smiled, gleamed forth two rows of pearl-white
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling came across Sintram that he must already have seen this knight
      somewhere; and he stood motionless for a few moments. But suddenly he
      raised his hand, to make the agreed signal of attack. In vain did the good
      Rolf, who had just succeeded in getting up to him, whisper in his ear that
      these could not be the foes whom he had taken them for, but that they were
      unknown, and certainly high and noble strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them be who they may,&rdquo; replied the wild youth, &ldquo;they have enticed me
      here to wait, and they shall pay the penalty of thus fooling me. Say not
      another word, if you value your life.&rdquo; And immediately he gave the signal,
      a thick shower of javelins followed from all sides, and the Norwegian
      warriors rushed forth with flashing swords. They found their foes as
      brave, or somewhat braver, than they could have desired. More fell on the
      side of those who made than of those who received the assault; and the
      strangers appeared to understand surprisingly the Norwegian manner of
      fighting. The knight in steel armour had not in his haste put on his
      helmet; but it seemed as if he in no wise needed such protection, for his
      good sword afforded him sufficient defence even against the spears and
      darts which were incessantly hurled at him, as with rapid skill he
      received them on the shining blade, and dashed them far away, shivered
      into fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram could not at the first onset penetrate to where this shining hero
      was standing, as all his followers, eager after such a noble prey,
      thronged closely round him; but now the way was cleared enough for him to
      spring towards the brave stranger, shouting a war-cry, and brandishing his
      sword above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gabrielle!&rdquo; cried the knight, as he dexterously parried the heavy blow
      which was descending, and with one powerful sword-thrust he laid the youth
      prostrate on the ground; then placing his knee on Sintram&rsquo;s breast, he
      drew forth a flashing dagger, and held it before his eyes as he lay
      astonished. All at once the men-at-arms stood round like walls. Sintram
      felt that no hope remained for him. He determined to die as it became a
      bold warrior; and without giving one sign of emotion, he looked on the
      fatal weapon with a steady gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lay with his eyes cast upwards, he fancied that there appeared
      suddenly from heaven a wondrously beautiful female form in a bright attire
      of blue and gold. &ldquo;Our ancestors told truly of the Valkyrias,&rdquo; murmured
      he. &ldquo;Strike, then, thou unknown conqueror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But with this the knight did not comply, neither was it a Valkyria who had
      so suddenly appeared, but the beautiful wife of the stranger, who, having
      advanced to the high edge of the vessel, had thus met the upraised look of
      Sintram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folko,&rdquo; cried she, in the softest tone, &ldquo;thou knight without reproach! I
      know that thou sparest the vanquished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight sprang up, and with courtly grace stretched out his hand to the
      conquered youth, saying, &ldquo;Thank the noble lady of Montfaucon for your life
      and liberty. But if you are so totally devoid of all goodness as to wish
      to resume the combat, here am I; let it be yours to begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram sank, deeply ashamed, on his knees, and wept; for he had often
      heard speak of the high renown of the French knight Folko of Montfaucon,
      who was related to his father&rsquo;s house, and of the grace and beauty of his
      gentle lady Gabrielle.
    </p>

      <img src="images/sintram4a.jpg" alt="sintram4a" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The Lord of Montfaucon looked with astonishment at his strange foe; and as
      he gazed on him more and more, recollections arose in his mind of that
      northern race from whom he was descended, and with whom he had always
      maintained friendly relations. A golden bear&rsquo;s claw, with which Sintram&rsquo;s
      cloak was fastened, at length made all clear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a valiant and far-famed kinsman, called the
      Sea-king Arinbiorn, who carries on his helmet golden vulture-wings? And is
      not your father the knight Biorn? For surely the bear&rsquo;s claw on your
      mantle must be the cognisance of your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram assented to all this, in deep and humble shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight of Montfaucon raised him from the ground, and said gravely, yet
      gently, &ldquo;We are, then, of kin the one to the other; but I could never have
      believed that any one of our noble house would attack a peaceful man
      without provocation, and that, too, without giving warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slay me at once,&rdquo; answered Sintram, &ldquo;if indeed I am worthy to die by so
      noble hands. I can no longer endure the light of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you have been overcome?&rdquo; asked Montfaucon. Sintram shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is it, rather, because you have committed an unknightly action?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glow of shame that overspread the youth&rsquo;s countenance said yes to
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should not on that account wish to die,&rdquo; continued Montfaucon.
      &ldquo;You should rather wish to live, that you may prove your repentance, and
      make your name illustrious by many noble deeds; for you are endowed with a
      bold spirit and with strength of limb, and also with the eagle-glance of a
      chieftain. I should have made you a knight this very hour, if you had
      borne yourself as bravely in a good cause as you have just now in a bad.
      See to it, that I may do it soon. You may yet become a vessel of high
      honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A joyous sound of shawms and silver rebecks interrupted his discourse. The
      lady Gabrielle, bright as the morning, had now come down from the ship,
      surrounded by her maidens; and, instructed in a few words by Folko who was
      his late foe, she took the combat as some mere trial of arms, saying, &ldquo;You
      must not be cast down, noble youth, because my wedded lord has won the
      prize; for be it known to you, that in the whole world there is but one
      knight who can boast of not having been overcome by the Baron of
      Montfaucon. And who can say,&rdquo; continued she, sportively, &ldquo;whether even
      that would have happened, had he not set himself to win back the magic
      ring from me, his lady- love, destined to him, as well by the choice of my
      own heart as by the will of Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folko, smiling, bent his head over the snow-white hand of his lady; and
      then bade the youth conduct them to his father&rsquo;s castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolf took upon himself to see to the disembarking of the horses and
      valuables of the strangers, filled with joy at the thought that an angel
      in woman&rsquo;s form had appeared to soften his beloved young master, and
      perhaps even to free him from that early curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram sent messengers in all directions to seek for his father, and to
      announce to him the arrival of his noble guests. They therefore found the
      old knight in his castle, with everything prepared for their reception.
      Gabrielle could not enter the vast dark-looking building without a slight
      shudder, which was increased when she saw the rolling fiery eyes of its
      lord; even the pale, dark-haired Sintram seemed to her very fearful; and
      she sighed to herself, &ldquo;Oh! what an awful abode have you brought me to
      visit, my knight! Would that we were once again in my sunny Gascony, or in
      your knightly Normandy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the grave yet courteous reception, the deep respect paid to her grace
      and beauty, and to the high fame of Folko, helped to re-assure her; and
      soon her bird-like pleasure in novelties was awakened through the strange
      significant appearance of this new world. And besides, it could only be
      for a passing moment that any womanly fears found a place in her breast
      when her lord was near at hand, for well did she know what effectual
      protection that brave Baron was ever ready to afford to all those who were
      dear to him, or committed to his charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards Rolf passed through the great hall in which Biorn and his
      guests were seated, conducting their attendants, who had charge of the
      baggage, to their rooms. Gabrielle caught sight of her favourite lute, and
      desired a page to bring it to her, that she might see if the precious
      instrument had been injured by the sea-voyage. As she bent over it with
      earnest attention, and her taper fingers ran up and down the strings, a
      smile, like the dawn of spring, passed over the dark countenances of Biorn
      and his son; and both said, with an involuntary sigh, &ldquo;Ah! if you would
      but play on that lute, and sing to it! It would be but too beautiful!&rdquo; The
      lady looked up at them, well pleased, and smiling her assent, she began
      this song:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Songs and flowers are returning,<br /> And radiant skies of May,<br />
      Earth her choicest gifts is yielding,<br /> But one is past away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring that clothes with tend&rsquo;rest green<br /> Each grove and sunny
      plain,<br /> Shines not for my forsaken heart,<br /> Brings not my joys
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warble not so, thou nightingale,<br /> Upon thy blooming spray,<br /> Thy
      sweetness now will burst my heart,<br /> I cannot bear thy lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      For flowers and birds are come again,<br /> And breezes mild of May,<br />
      But treasured hopes and golden hours<br /> Are lost to me for aye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Norwegians sat plunged in melancholy thought; but especially
      Sintram&rsquo;s eyes began to brighten with a milder expression, his cheeks
      glowed, every feature softened, till those who looked at him could have
      fancied they saw a glorified spirit. The good Rolf, who had stood
      listening to the song, rejoiced thereat from his heart, and devoutly
      raised his hands in pious gratitude to heaven. But Gabrielle&rsquo;s
      astonishment suffered her not to take her eyes from Sintram. At last she
      said to him, &ldquo;I should much like to know what has so struck you in that
      little song. It is merely a simple lay of the spring, full of the images
      which that sweet season never fails to call up in the minds of my
      countrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is your home really so lovely, so wondrously rich in song?&rdquo; cried the
      enraptured Sintram. &ldquo;Then I am no longer surprised at your heavenly
      beauty, at the power which you exercise over my hard, wayward heart! For a
      paradise of song must surely send such angelic messengers through the
      ruder parts of the world.&rdquo; And so saying, he fell on his knees before the
      lady in an attitude of deep humility. Folko looked on all the while with
      an approving smile, whilst Gabrielle, in much embarrassment, seemed hardly
      to know how to treat the half-wild, half-tamed young stranger. After some
      hesitation, however, she held out her fair hand to him, and said as she
      gently raised him: &ldquo;Surely one who listens with such delight to music must
      himself know how to awaken its strains. Take my lute, and let us hear a
      graceful inspired song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sintram drew back, and would not take the instrument; and he said,
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid that my rough untutored hand should touch those delicate
      strings! For even were I to begin with some soft strains, yet before long
      the wild spirit which dwells in me would break out, and there would be an
      end of the form and sound of the beautiful instrument. No, no; suffer me
      rather to fetch my own huge harp, strung with bears&rsquo; sinews set in brass,
      for in truth I do feel myself inspired to play and sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle murmured a half-frightened assent; and Sintram having quickly
      brought his harp, began to strike it loudly, and to sing these words with
      a voice no less powerful:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir knight, sir knight, oh! whither away<br /> With thy snow-white sail on
      the foaming spray?"<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too long have I trod upon ice and snow;<br /> I seek the bowers where
      roses blow."<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      He steer&rsquo;d on his course by night and day<br /> Till he cast his anchor in
      Naples Bay.<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      There wander&rsquo;d a lady upon the strand,<br /> Her fair hair bound with a
      golden band.<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail to thee! hail to thee! lady bright,<br /> Mine own shalt thou be ere
      morning light."<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, sir knight,&rdquo; the lady replied,<br /> &ldquo;For you speak to the
      margrave&rsquo;s chosen bride."<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of
      flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lover may come with his shield and spear,<br /> And the victor shall
      win thee, lady dear!&rdquo;<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, seek for another bride, I pray;<br /> Most fair are the maidens of
      Naples Bay."<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, lady; for thee my heart doth burn,<br /> And the world cannot now my
      purpose turn."<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the young margrave, bold and brave;<br /> But low was he laid in
      a grassy grave.<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the fierce Northman joyously cried,<br /> &ldquo;Now shall I possess
      lands, castle, and bride!&rdquo;<br /> Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of
      flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram&rsquo;s song was ended, but his eyes glared wildly, and the vibrations
      of the harp-strings still resounded in a marvellous manner. Biorn&rsquo;s
      attitude was again erect; he stroked his long beard and rattled his sword,
      as if in great delight at what he had just heard. Much shuddered Gabrielle
      before the wild song and these strange forms, but only till she cast a
      glance on the Lord of Montfaucon, sat there smiling in all his hero
      strength, unmoved, the rough uproar passed by him like an autumnal storm.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 7
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some weeks after this, in the twilight of evening, Sintram, very
      disturbed, came down to the castle-garden. Although the presence of
      Gabrielle never failed to soothe and calm him, yet if she left the
      apartment for even a few instants, the fearful wildness of his spirit
      seemed to return with renewed strength. So even now, after having long and
      kindly read legends of the olden times to his father Biorn, she had
      retired to her chamber. The tones of her lute could be distinctly heard in
      the garden below; but the sounds only drove the bewildered youth more
      impetuously through the shades of the ancient elms. Stooping suddenly to
      avoid some overhanging branches, he unexpectedly came upon something
      against which he had almost struck, and which, at first sight, he took for
      a small bear standing on its hind legs, with a long and strangely crooked
      horn on its head. He drew back in surprise and fear. It addressed him in a
      grating man&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Well, my brave young knight, whence come you?
      whither go you? wherefore so terrified?&rdquo; And then first he saw that he had
      before him a little old man so wrapped up in a rough garment of fur, that
      scarcely one of his features was visible, and wearing in his cap a
      strange-looking long feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whence come YOU and whither go YOU?&rdquo; returned the angry Sintram. &ldquo;For
      of you such questions should be asked. What have you to do in our domains,
      you hideous little being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; sneered the other one, &ldquo;I am thinking that I am quite big
      enough as I am&mdash;one cannot always be a giant. And as to the rest, why
      should you find fault that I go here hunting for snails? Surely snails do
      not belong to the game which your high mightinesses consider that you
      alone have a right to follow! Now, on the other hand, I know how to
      prepare from them an excellent high-flavoured drink; and I have taken
      enough for to-day: marvellous fat little beasts, with wise faces like a
      man&rsquo;s, and long twisted horns on their heads. Would you like to see them?
      Look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he began to unfasten and fumble about his fur garment; but
      Sintram, filled with disgust and horror, said, &ldquo;Psha! I detest such
      animals! Be quiet, and tell me at once who and what you yourself are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you so bent upon knowing my name?&rdquo; replied the little man. &ldquo;Let it
      content you that I am master of all secret knowledge, and well versed in
      the most intricate depths of ancient history. Ah! my young sir, if you
      would only hear them! But you are afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of you!&rdquo; cried Sintram, with a wild laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many a better man than you has been so before now,&rdquo; muttered the little
      Master; &ldquo;but they did not like being told of it any more than you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prove that you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Sintram, &ldquo;I will remain here with
      you till the moon stands high in the heavens. But you must tell me one of
      your stories the while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man, much pleased, nodded his head; and as they paced together
      up and down a retired elm-walk, he began discoursing as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many hundred years ago a young knight, called Paris of Troy, lived in
      that sunny land of the south where are found the sweetest songs, the
      brightest flowers, and the most beautiful ladies. You know a song that
      tells of that fair land, do you not, young sir? &lsquo;Sing heigh, sing ho, for
      that land of flowers.&rsquo;&rdquo; Sintram bowed his head in assent, and sighed
      deeply. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; resumed the little Master, &ldquo;it happened that Paris led that
      kind of life which is not uncommon in those countries, and of which their
      poets often sing&mdash;he would pass whole months together in the garb of
      a peasant, piping in the woods and mountains and pasturing his flocks.
      Here one day three beautiful sorceresses appeared to him, disputing about
      a golden apple; and from him they sought to know which of them was the
      most beautiful, since to her the golden fruit was to be awarded. The first
      knew how to give thrones, and sceptres, and crowns; the second could give
      wisdom and knowledge; and the third could prepare philtres and love-charms
      which could not fail of securing the affections of the fairest of women.
      Each one in turn proffered her choicest gifts to the young shepherd, in
      order that, tempted by them, he might adjudge the apple to her. But as
      fair women charmed him more than anything else in the world, he said that
      the third was the most beautiful&mdash;her name was Venus. The two others
      departed in great displeasure; but Venus bid him put on his knightly
      armour and his helmet adorned with waving feathers, and then she led him
      to a famous city called Sparta, where ruled the noble Duke Menelaus. His
      young Duchess Helen was the loveliest woman on earth, and the sorceress
      offered her to Paris in return for the golden apple. He was most ready to
      have her and wished for nothing better; but he asked how he was to gain
      possession of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paris must have been a sorry knight,&rdquo; interrupted Sintram. &ldquo;Such things
      are easily settled. The husband is challenged to a single combat, and he
      that is victorious carries off the wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Duke Menelaus was the host of the young knight,&rdquo; said the narrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, little Master,&rdquo; cried Sintram; &ldquo;he might have asked the
      sorceress for some other beautiful woman, and then have mounted his horse,
      or weighed anchor, and departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; it is very easy to say so,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;But if you
      only knew how bewitchingly lovely this Duchess Helen was, no room was left
      for change.&rdquo; And then he began a glowing description of the charms of this
      wondrously beautiful woman, but likening the image to Gabrielle so
      closely, feature for feature, that Sintram, tottering, was forced to lean
      against a tree. The little Master stood opposite to him grinning, and
      asked, &ldquo;Well now, could you have advised that poor knight Paris to fly
      from her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me at once what happened next,&rdquo; stammered Sintram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sorceress acted honourably towards Paris,&rdquo; continued the old man.
      &ldquo;She declared to him that if he would carry away the lovely duchess to his
      own city Troy, he might do so, and thus cause the ruin of his whole house
      and of his country; but that during ten years he would be able to defend
      himself in Troy, and rejoice in the sweet love of Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he accepted those terms, or he was a fool!&rdquo; cried the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he accepted them,&rdquo; whispered the little Master. &ldquo;I would have
      done so in his place! And do you know, young sir, the look of things then
      was just as they are happening to-day. The newly-risen moon, partly veiled
      by clouds, was shining dimly through the thick branches of the trees in
      the silence of evening. Leaning against an old tree, as you now are doing,
      stood the young enamoured knight Paris, and at his side the enchantress
      Venus, but so disguised and transformed, that she did not look much more
      beautiful than I do. And by the silvery light of the moon, the form of the
      beautiful beloved one was seen sweeping by alone amidst the whispering
      boughs.&rdquo; He was silent, and like as in the mirror of his deluding words,
      Gabrielle just then actually herself appeared, musing as she walked alone
      down the alley of elms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man,&mdash;fearful Master,&mdash;by what name shall I call you? To what
      would you drive me?&rdquo; muttered the trembling Sintram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou knowest thy father&rsquo;s strong stone castle on the Moon-rocks?&rdquo; replied
      the old man. &ldquo;The castellan and the garrison are true and devoted to thee.
      It could stand a ten years&rsquo; siege; and the little gate which leads to the
      hills is open, as was that of the citadel of Sparta for Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, the youth saw through a gate, left open he knew not how, the
      dim, distant mountains glittering in the moonlight. &ldquo;And if he did not
      accept, he was a fool,&rdquo; said the little Master, with a grin, echoing
      Sintram&rsquo;s former words.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Gabrielle stood close by him. She was within reach of his
      grasp, had he made the least movement; and a moonbeam, suddenly breaking
      forth, transfigured, as it were, her heavenly beauty. The youth had
      already bent forward&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord and God, I pray,<br /> Turn from his heart away<br /> This world&rsquo;s
      turmoil;<br /> And call him to Thy light,<br /> Be it through sorrow&rsquo;s
      night,<br /> Through pain or toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were sung by old Rolf at that very time, as he lingered on the
      still margin of the castle fish-pond, where he prayed alone to Heaven,
      full of foreboding care. They reached Sintram&rsquo;s ear; he stood as if
      spellbound and made the Sign of the Cross. Immediately the little master
      fled away, jumping uncouthly on one leg, through the gates and shutting
      them after him with a yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle shuddered, terrified at the wild noise. Sintram approached her
      softly, and said, offering his arm to her: &ldquo;Suffer me to lead you back to
      the castle. The night in these northern regions is often wild and
      fearful.&rdquo;

    <p>
      They found the two knights drinking wine within. Folko was relating
      stories in his usual mild and cheerful manner, and Biorn was listening
      with a moody air, but yet as if, against his will, the dark cloud might
      pass away before that bright and gentle courtesy. Gabrielle saluted the
      baron with a smile, and signed to him to continue his discourse, as she
      took her place near the knight Biorn, full of watchful kindness. Sintram
      stood by the hearth, abstracted and melancholy; and the embers, as he
      stirred them, cast a strange glow over his pallid features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of all the German trading-towns,&rdquo; continued Montfaucon, &ldquo;the largest
      and richest is Hamburgh. In Normandy we willingly see their merchants land
      on our coasts, and those excellent people never fail to prove themselves
      our friends when we seek their advice and assistance. When I first visited
      Hamburgh, every honour and respect was paid to me. I found its inhabitants
      engaged in a war with a neighbouring count, and immediately I used my
      sword for them, vigorously and successfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sword! your knightly sword!&rdquo; interrupted Biorn; and the old wonted
      fire flashed from his eyes. &ldquo;Against a knight, and for shopkeepers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir knight,&rdquo; replied Folko, calmly, &ldquo;the barons of Montfaucon have ever
      used their swords as they chose, without the interference of another; and
      as I have received this good custom, so do I wish to hand it on. If you
      agree not to this, so speak it freely out. But I forbid every rude word
      against the men of Hamburgh, since I have declared them to be my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn cast down his haughty eyes, and their fire faded away. In a low
      voice he said, &ldquo;Proceed, noble baron. You are right, and I am wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Folko stretched out his hand to him across the table, and resumed his
      narration: &ldquo;Amongst all my beloved Hamburghers the dearest to me are two
      men of marvellous experience&mdash;a father and son. What have they not
      seen and done in the remotest corners of the earth, and instituted in
      their native town! Praise be to God, my life cannot be called unfruitful;
      but, compared with the wise Gotthard Lenz and his stout-hearted son
      Rudlieb, I look upon myself as an esquire who has perhaps been some few
      times to tourneys, and, besides that, has never hunted out his own
      forests. They have converted, subdued, gladdened, dark men whom I know not
      how to name; and the wealth which they have brought back with them has all
      been devoted to the common weal, as if fit for no other purpose. On their
      return from their long and perilous sea-voyages, they hasten to an
      hospital which has been founded by them, and where they undertake the part
      of overseers, and of careful and patient nurses. Then they proceed to
      select the most fitting spots whereon to erect new towers and fortresses
      for the defence of their beloved country. Next they repair to the houses
      where strangers and travellers receive hospitality at their cost; and at
      last they return to their own abode, to entertain their guests, rich and
      noble like kings, and simple and unconstrained like shepherds. Many a tale
      of their wondrous adventures serves to enliven these sumptuous feasts.
      Amongst others, I remember to have heard my friends relate one at which my
      hair stood on end. Possibly I may gain some more complete information on
      the subject from you. It appears that several years ago, just about the
      time of the Christmas festival, Gotthard and Rudlieb were shipwrecked on
      the coast of Norway, during a violent winter tempest. They could never
      exactly ascertain the situation of the rocks on which their vessel
      stranded; but so much is certain, that very near the sea-shore stood a
      huge castle, to which the father and son betook themselves, seeking for
      that assistance and shelter which Christian people are ever willing to
      afford each other in case of need. They went alone, leaving their
      followers to watch the injured ship. The castle-gates were thrown open,
      and they thought all was well. But on a sudden the court-yard was filled
      with armed men, who with one accord aimed their sharp iron-pointed spears
      at the defenceless strangers, whose dignified remonstrances and mild
      entreaties were only heard in sullen silence or with scornful jeerings.
      After a while a knight came down the stairs, with fire- flashing eyes.
      They hardly knew whether to think they saw a spectre, or a wild heathen;
      he gave a signal, and the fatal spears closed around them. At that instant
      the soft tones of a woman&rsquo;s voice fell on their ear, calling on the
      Saviour&rsquo;s holy name for aid; at the sound, the spectres in the court-yard
      rushed madly one against the other, the gates burst open, and Gotthard and
      Rudlieb fled away, catching a glimpse as they went of an angelic woman who
      appeared at one of the windows of the castle. They made every exertion to
      get their ship again afloat, choosing to trust themselves to the sea
      rather than to that barbarous coast; and at last, after manifold dangers,
      they landed at Denmark. They say that some heathen must have owned the
      cruel castle; but I hold it to be some ruined fortress, deserted by men,
      in which hellish spectres were wont to hold their nightly meetings. What
      heathen could be found so demon- like as to offer death to shipwrecked
      strangers, instead of refreshment and shelter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn gazed fixedly on the ground, as though he were turned into stone but
      Sintram came towards the table, and said, &ldquo;Father, let us seek out this
      godless abode, and lay it level with the dust. I cannot tell how, but
      somehow I feel quite sure that the accursed deed of which we have just
      heard is alone the cause of my frightful dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enraged at his son, Biorn rose up, and would perhaps again have uttered
      some dreadful words; but Heaven decreed otherwise, for just at that moment
      the pealing notes a trumpet were heard, which drowned the angry tones his
      voice, the great doors opened slowly, and a herald entered the hall. He
      bowed reverently, and then said, &ldquo;I am sent by Jarl Eric the Aged. He
      returned two days ago from his expedition to the Grecian seas. His wish
      had been to take vengeance on the island which is called Chios, where
      fifty years ago his father was slain by the soldiers of the Emperor. But
      your kinsman, the sea- king Arinbiorn, who was lying there at anchor,
      tried to pacify him. To this Jarl Eric would not listen; so the sea-king
      said next that he would never suffer Chios to be laid waste, because it
      was an island where the lays of an old Greek bard, called Homer, were
      excellently sung, and where more-over a very choice wine was made. Words
      proving of no avail, a combat ensued; in which Arinbiorn had so much the
      advantage that Jarl Eric lost two of his ships, and only with difficulty
      escaped in one which had already sustained great damage. Eric the Aged has
      now resolved to take revenge on some of the sea- king&rsquo;s race, since
      Arinbiorn himself is seldom on the spot. Will you, Biorn of the Fiery
      Eyes, at once pay as large a penalty in cattle, and money, and goods, as
      it may please the Jarl to demand? Or will you prepare to meet him with an
      armed force at Niflung&rsquo;s Heath seven days hence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn bowed his head quietly, and replied in a mild tone, &ldquo;Seven days
      hence at Niflung&rsquo;s Heath.&rdquo; He then offered to the herald a golden goblet
      full of rich wine, and added, &ldquo;Drink that, and then carry off with thee
      the cup which thou hast emptied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron of Montfaucon likewise sends greeting to thy chieftain, Jarl
      Eric,&rdquo; interposed Folko; &ldquo;and engages to be also at Niflung&rsquo;s Heath, as
      the hereditary friend of the sea-king, and also as the kinsman and guest
      of Biorn of the Fiery Eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The herald was seen to tremble at the name of Montfaucon; he bowed very
      low, cast an anxious, reverential look at the baron, and left the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle looked on her knight, smiling lovingly and securely, for she
      well knew his victorious prowess; and she only asked, &ldquo;Where shall I
      remain, whilst you go forth to battle, Folko?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped,&rdquo; answered Biorn, &ldquo;that you would be well contented to stay
      in this castle, lovely lady; I leave my son to guard you and attend on
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle hesitated an instant; and Sintram, who had resumed his position
      near the fire, muttered to himself as he fixed his eyes on the bright
      flames which were flashing up, &ldquo;Yes, yes, so it will probably happen. I
      can fancy that Duke Menelaus had just left Sparta on some warlike
      expedition, when the young knight Paris met the lovely Helen that evening
      in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gabrielle, shuddering although she knew not why, said quickly,
      &ldquo;Without you, Folko? And must I forego the joy of seeing you fight? or the
      honour of tending you, should you chance to receive a wound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folko bowed, gracefully thanking his lady, and replied, &ldquo;Come with your
      knight, since such is your pleasure, and be to him a bright guiding star.
      It is a good old northern custom that ladies should be present at knightly
      combats, and no true warrior of the north will fail to respect the place
      whence beams the light of their eyes. Unless, indeed,&rdquo; continued he with
      an inquiring look at Biorn, &ldquo;unless Jarl Eric is not worthy of his
      forefather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of honour,&rdquo; said Biorn confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then array yourself, my fairest love,&rdquo; said the delighted Folko; &ldquo;array
      yourself and come forth with us to the battle-field to behold and judge
      our deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come forth with us to the battle,&rdquo; echoed Sintram in a sudden transport
      of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they all dispersed in calm cheerfulness; Sintram betaking himself
      again to the wood, while the others retired to rest.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 9
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a wild dreary tract of country that, which bore the name of
      Niflung&rsquo;s Heath. According to tradition, the young Niflung, son of Hogni,
      the last of his race, had there ended darkly a sad and unsuccessful life.
      Many ancient grave-stones were still standing round about; and in the few
      oak-trees scattered here and there over the plain, huge eagles had built
      their nests. The beating of their heavy wings as they fought together, and
      their wild screams, were heard far off in more thickly-peopled regions;
      and at the sound children would tremble in their cradles, and old men
      quake with fear as they slumbered over the blazing hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the seventh night, the last before the day of combat, was just
      beginning, two large armies were seen descending from the hills in
      opposite directions; that which came from the west was commanded by Eric
      the Aged, that from the east by Biorn of the Fiery Eyes. They appeared
      thus early in compliance with the custom which required that adversaries
      should always present themselves at the appointed field of battle before
      the time named, in order to prove that they rather sought than dreaded the
      fight. Folko forthwith pitched on the most convenient spot the tent of
      blue samite fringed with gold, which he carried with him to shelter his
      gentle lady; whilst Sintram, in the character of herald, rode over to Jarl
      Eric to announce to him that the beauteous Gabrielle of Montfaucon was
      present in the army of the knight Biorn, and would the next morning be
      present as a judge of the combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jarl Eric bowed low on receiving this pleasing message; and ordered his
      bards to strike up a lay, the words of which ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warriors bold of Eric&rsquo;s band,<br /> Gird your glittering armour on,<br />
      Stand beneath to-morrow&rsquo;s sun,<br /> In your might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fairest dame that ever gladden&rsquo;d<br /> Our wild shores with beauty&rsquo;s
      vision,<br /> May thy bright eyes o&rsquo;er our combat,<br /> Judge the right!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tidings of yon noble stranger<br /> Long ago have reach&rsquo;d our ears,<br />
      Wafted upon southern breezes,<br /> O&rsquo;er the wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now midst yonder hostile ranks,<br /> In his warlike pride he meets us,<br />
      Folko comes! Fight, men of Eric,<br /> True and brave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These wondrous tones floated over the plain, and reached the tent of
      Gabrielle. It was no new thing to her to hear her knight&rsquo;s fame celebrated
      on all sides; but now that she listened to his praises bursting forth in
      the stillness of night from the mouth of his enemies, she could scarce
      refrain from kneeling at the feet of the mighty chieftain. But he with
      courteous tenderness held her up, and pressing his lips fervently on her
      soft hand, he said, &ldquo;My deeds, O lovely lady, belong to thee, and not to
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the night had passed away, and the east was glowing; and on Niflung&rsquo;s
      Heath there was waving, and resounding, and glowing too. Knights put on
      their rattling armour, war-horses began to neigh, the morning draught went
      round in gold and silver goblets, while war- songs and the clang of harps
      resounded in the midst. A joyous march was heard in Biorn&rsquo;s camp, as
      Montfaucon, with his troops and retainers, clad in bright steel armour,
      conducted their lady up to a neighbouring hill, where she would be safe
      from the spears which would soon be flying in all directions, and whence
      she could look freely over the battle-field. The morning sun, as it were
      in homage, played over her beauty; and as she came in view of the camp of
      Jarl Eric, his soldiers lowered their weapons, whilst the chieftains bent
      low the crests of their huge helmets. Two of Montfaucon&rsquo;s pages remained
      in attendance on Gabrielle; for so noble a service not unwillingly
      bridling their love of fighting. Both armies passed in front of her,
      saluting her and singing as they went; they then placed themselves in
      array, and the fight began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spears flew from the hands of the stout northern warriors, rattling
      against the broad shields under which they sheltered themselves, or
      sometimes clattering as they met in the air; at intervals, on one side or
      the other, a man was struck, and fell silent in his blood. Then the Knight
      of Montfaucon advanced with his troop of Norman horsemen&mdash;even as he
      dashed past, he did not fail to lower his shining sword to salute
      Gabrielle; and then with an exulting war-cry, which burst from many a
      voice, they charged the left wing of the enemy. Eric&rsquo;s foot-soldiers,
      kneeling firmly, received them with fixed javelins&mdash;many a noble
      horse fell wounded to death, and in falling brought his rider with him to
      the ground; others again crushed their foes under them in their
      death-fall. Folko rushed through&mdash;he and his war-steed unwounded&mdash;followed
      by a troop of chosen knights. Already were they falling into disorder&mdash;
      already were Biorn&rsquo;s warriors giving shouts of victory&mdash;when a troop
      of horse, headed by Jarl Eric himself, advanced against the valiant baron;
      and whilst his Normans, hastily assembled, assisted him in repelling this
      new attack, the enemy&rsquo;s infantry were gradually forming themselves into a
      thick mass, which rolled on and on. All these movements seemed caused by a
      warrior whose loud piercing shout was in the midst. And scarcely were the
      troops formed into this strange array, when suddenly they spread
      themselves out on all sides, carrying everything before them with the
      irresistible force of the burning torrent from Hecla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biorn&rsquo;s soldiers, who had thought to enclose their enemies, lost courage
      and gave way before this wondrous onset. The knight himself in vain
      attempted to stem the tide of fugitives, and with difficulty escaped being
      carried away by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram stood looking on this scene of confusion with mute indignation;
      friends and foes passed by him, all equally avoiding him, and dreading to
      come in contact with one whose aspect was so fearful, nay, almost
      unearthly, in his motionless rage. He aimed no blow either to right or
      left; his powerful battle-axe rested in his hand; but his eyes flashed
      fire, and seemed to be piercing the enemy&rsquo;s ranks through and through, as
      if he would find out who it was that had conjured up this sudden warlike
      spirit. He succeeded. A small man clothed in strange-looking armour, with
      large golden horns on his helmet, and a long visor advancing in front of
      it, was leaning on a two-edged curved spear, and seemed to be looking with
      derision at the flight of Biorn&rsquo;s troops as they were pursued by their
      victorious foes. &ldquo;That is he,&rdquo; cried Sintram; &ldquo;he who will drive us from
      the field before the eyes of Gabrielle!&rdquo; And with the swiftness of an
      arrow he flew towards him with a wild shout. The combat was fierce, but
      not of long duration. To the wondrous dexterity of his adversary, Sintram
      opposed his far superior size; and he dealt so fearful a blow on the
      horned helmet, that a stream of blood rushed forth, the small man fell as
      if stunned, and after some frightful convulsive movements, his limbs
      appeared to stiffen in death.

    </div>
    <p>
      His fall gave the signal for that of all Eric&rsquo;s army. Even those who had
      not seen him fall, suddenly lost their courage and eagerness for the
      battle, and retreated with uncertain steps, or ran in wild affright on the
      spears of their enemies. At the same time Montfaucon was dispersing Jarl
      Eric&rsquo;s cavalry, after a desperate conflict&mdash;had hurled their chief
      from the saddle, and taken him prisoner with his own hand. Biorn of the
      Fiery Eyes stood victorious in the middle of the field of battle. The day
      was won.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 10
    </h3>
    <p>
      In sight of both armies, with glowing cheeks and looks of modest humility,
      Sintram was conducted by the brave baron up the hill where Gabrielle stood
      in all the lustre of her beauty. Both warriors bent the knee before her,
      and Folko said, solemnly, &ldquo;Lady, this valiant youth of a noble race has
      deserved the reward of this day&rsquo;s victory. I pray you let him receive it
      from your fair hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle bowed courteously, took off her scarf of blue and gold, and
      fastened it to a bright sword, which a page brought to her on a cushion of
      cloth of silver. She then, with a smile, presented the noble gift to
      Sintram, who was bending forward to receive it, when suddenly Gabrielle
      drew back, and turning to Folko, said, &ldquo;Noble baron, should not he on whom
      I bestow a scarf and sword be first admitted into the order of
      knighthood?&rdquo; Light as a feather, Folko sprang up, and bowing low before
      his lady, gave the youth the accolade with solemn earnestness. Then
      Gabrielle buckled on his sword, saying, &ldquo;For the honour of God and the
      service of virtuous ladies, young knight. I saw you fight, I saw you
      conquer, and my earnest prayers followed you. Fight and conquer often
      again, as you have done this day, that the beams of your renown may shine
      over my far-distant country.&rdquo; And at a sign from Folko, she offered her
      tender lips for the new knight to kiss. Thrilling all over, and full of a
      holy joy, Sintram arose in deep silence, and hot tears streamed down his
      softened countenance, whilst the shout and the trumpets of the assembled
      troops greeted the youth with stunning applause. Old Rolf stood silently
      on one side, and as he looked in the mild beaming eyes of his
      foster-child, he calmly and piously returned thanks:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The strife at length hath found its end,<br /> Rich blessings now shall
      heaven send!<br /> The evil foe is slain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn and Jarl Eric had the while been talking together eagerly, but not
      unkindly. The conqueror now led his vanquished enemy up the hill and
      presented him to the baron and Gabrielle, saying, &ldquo;Instead of two enemies
      you now see two sworn allies; and I request you, my beloved guests and
      kinsfolk, to receive him graciously as one who henceforward belongs to
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was so always,&rdquo; added Eric, smiling; &ldquo;I sought, indeed, revenge; but I
      have now had enough of defeats both by sea and land. Yet I thank Heaven
      that neither in the Grecian seas, to the sea-king, nor in Niflung&rsquo;s Heath,
      to you, have I yielded ingloriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lord of Montfaucon assented cordially, and heartily and solemnly was
      reconciliation made. Then Jarl Eric addressed Gabrielle with so noble a
      grace, that with a smile of wonder she gazed on the gigantic grey hero,
      and gave him her beautiful hand to kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sintram was speaking earnestly to his good Rolf; and at length
      he was heard to say, &ldquo;But before all, be sure that you bury that
      wonderfully brave knight whom my battle-axe smote. Choose out the greenest
      hill for his resting-place, and the loftiest oak to shade his grave. Also,
      I wish you to open his visor, and to examine his countenance carefully,
      that so, though mortally smitten, we may not bury him alive; and moreover,
      that you may be able to describe to me him to whom I owe the noblest prize
      of victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rolf bowed readily, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our young knight is speaking there of one amongst the slain of whom I
      should like to hear more,&rdquo; said Folko, turning to Jarl Eric. &ldquo;Who, dear
      Jarl, was that wonderful chieftain who led on your troops so skilfully,
      and who at last fell under Sintram&rsquo;s powerful battle-axe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me more than I know how to answer,&rdquo; replied Jarl Eric. &ldquo;About
      three nights ago this stranger made his appearance amongst us. I was
      sitting with my chieftains and warriors round the hearth, forging our
      armour, and singing the while. Suddenly, above the din of our hammering
      and our singing, we heard so loud a noise that it silenced us in a moment,
      and we sat motionless as if we had been turned into stone. Before long the
      sound was repeated; and at last we made out that it must be caused by some
      person blowing a huge horn outside the castle, seeking for admittance. I
      went down myself to the gate, and as I passed through the court-yard all
      my dogs were so terrified by the extraordinary noise, as to be howling and
      crouching in their kennels instead of barking. I chid them, and called to
      them, but even the fiercest would not follow me. Then, thought I, I must
      show you the way to set to work; so I grasped my sword firmly, I set my
      torch on the ground close beside me, and I let the gates fly open without
      further delay. For I well knew that it would be no easy matter for any one
      to come in against my will. A loud laugh greeted me, and I heard these
      words, &lsquo;Well, well, what mighty preparations are these before one small
      man can find the shelter he seeks!&rsquo; And in truth I did feel myself redden
      with shame when I saw the small stranger standing opposite to me quite
      alone. I called to him to come in at once, and offered my hand to him; but
      he still showed some displeasure, and would not give me his in return. As
      he went up, however, he became more friendly&mdash;he showed me the golden
      horn on which he sounded that blast, and which he carried screwed on his
      helmet, as well as another exactly like it. When he was sitting with us in
      the hall, he behaved in a very strange manner&mdash;sometimes he was
      merry, sometimes cross; by turns courteous and rude in his demeanour,
      without any one being able to see a motive for such constant changes. I
      longed to know where he came from; but how could I ask my guest such a
      question? He told us as much as this, that he was starved with cold in our
      country, and that his own was much warmer. Also he appeared well
      acquainted with the city of Constantinople, and related fearful stories of
      how brothers, uncles, nephews, nay, even fathers and sons, thrust each
      other from the throne, blinded, cut out tongues, and murdered. At length
      he said his own name&mdash;it sounded harmonious, like a Greek name, but
      none of us could remember it. Before long he displayed his skill as an
      armourer. He understood marvellously well how to handle the red-hot iron,
      and how to form it into more murderous weapons than any I had ever before
      seen. I would not suffer him to go on making them, for I was resolved to
      meet you in the field with equal arms, and such as we are all used to in
      our northern countries. Then he laughed, and said he thought it would be
      quite possible to be victorious without them, by skilful movements and the
      like if only I would entrust the command of my infantry to him, I was sure
      of victory. Then I thought that he who makes arms well must also wield
      them well&mdash;yet I required some proof of his powers. Ye lords, he came
      off victorious in trials of strength such as you can hardly imagine; and
      although the fame of young Sintram, as a bold and brave warrior, is spread
      far and wide, yet I can scarce believe that he could slay such an one as
      my Greek ally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have continued speaking, but the good Rolf came hastily back with
      a few followers, the whole party so ghastly pale, that all eyes were
      involuntarily fixed on them, and looked anxiously to hear what tidings
      they had brought. Rolf stood still, silent and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take courage, my old friend!&rdquo; cried Sintram. &ldquo;Whatever thou mayest have
      to tell is truth and light from thy faithful mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear master,&rdquo; began the old man, &ldquo;be not angry, but as to burying that
      strange warrior whom you slew, it is a thing impossible. Would that we had
      never opened that wide hideous visor! For so horrible a countenance
      grinned at us from underneath it, so distorted by death, and with so
      hellish an expression, that we hardly kept our senses. We could not by any
      possibility have touched him. I would rather be sent to kill wolves and
      bears in the desert, and look on whilst fierce birds of prey feast on
      their carcases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All present shuddered, and were silent for a time, till Sintram nerved
      himself to say, &ldquo;Dear, good old man, why use such wild words as I never
      till now heard thee utter? But tell me, Jarl Eric, did your ally appear
      altogether so awful while he was yet alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as far as I know,&rdquo; answered Jarl Eric, looking inquiringly at his
      companions, who were standing around. They said the same thing; but on
      farther questioning, it appeared that neither the chieftain, nor the
      knights, nor the soldiers, could say exactly what the stranger was like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must then find it out for ourselves, and bury the corpse,&rdquo; said
      Sintram; and he signed to the assembled party to follow him. All did so
      except the Lord of Montfaucon, whom the whispered entreaty of Gabrielle
      kept at her side. He lost nothing thereby. For though Niflung&rsquo;s Heath was
      searched from one end to the other many times, yet the body of the unknown
      warrior was no longer to be found.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAPTER 11
    </h3>
    <p>
      The joyful calm which came over Sintram on this day appeared to be more
      than a passing gleam. If too, at times, a thought of the knight Paris and
      Helen would inflame his heart with bolder and wilder wishes, it needed but
      one look at his scarf and sword, and the stream of his inner life glided
      again clear as a mirror, and serene within. &ldquo;What can any man wish for
      more than has been already bestowed on me?&rdquo; would he say to himself at
      such times in still delight. And thus it went on for a long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful northern autumn had already begun to redden the leaves of
      the oaks and elms round the castle, when one day it chanced that Sintram
      was sitting in company with Folko and Gabrielle in almost the very same
      spot in the garden where he had before met that mysterious being whom,
      without knowing why, he had named the little Master. But on this day how
      different did everything appear! The sun was sinking slowly over the sea,
      the mist of an autumnal evening was rising from the fields and meadows
      around, towards the hill on which stood the huge castle. Gabrielle,
      placing her lute in Sintram&rsquo;s hands, said to him, &ldquo;Dear friend, so mild
      and gentle as you now are, I may well dare to entrust to you my tender
      little darling. Let me again hear you sing that lay of the land of
      flowers; for I am sure that it will now sound much sweeter than when you
      accompanied it with the vibrations of your fearful harp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young knight bowed as he prepared to obey the lady&rsquo;s commands. With a
      grace and softness hitherto unwonted, the tones resounded from his lips,
      and the wild song appeared to transform itself, and to bloom into a garden
      of the blessed. Tears stood in Gabrielle&rsquo;s eyes; and Sintram, as he gazed
      on the pearly brightness, poured forth tones of yet richer sweetness. When
      the last notes were sounded, Gabrielle&rsquo;s angelic voice was heard to echo
      them; and as she repeated,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing heigh, sing ho, for that land of flowers,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram put down the lute, and sighed with a thankful glance towards the
      stars, now rising in the heavens. Then Gabrielle, turning towards her
      lord, murmured these words: &ldquo;Oh, how long have we been far away from our
      own shining castles and bright gardens! Oh, for that land of the sweetest
      flowers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram could scarce believe that he heard aright, so suddenly did he feel
      himself as if shut out from paradise. But his last hope vanished before
      the courteous assurances of Folko that he would endeavour to fulfil his
      lady&rsquo;s wishes the very next week, and that their ship was lying off the
      shore ready to put to sea. She thanked him with a kiss imprinted softly on
      his forehead; and leaning on his arm, she bent her steps, singing and
      smiling, towards the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram, troubled in mind, as though turned into stone, remained behind
      forgotten. At length, when night was now in the sky, he started up wildly,
      ran up and down the garden, as if all his former madness had again taken
      possession of him; and then rushed out and wandered upon the wild moonlit
      hills. There he dashed his sword against the trees and bushes, so that on
      all sides was heard a sound of crashing and falling. The birds of night
      flew about him screeching in wild alarm; and the deer, startled by the
      noise, sprang away and took refuge in the thickest coverts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a sudden old Rolf appeared, returning home from a visit to the chaplain
      of Drontheim, to whom he had been relating, with tears of joy, how Sintram
      was softened by the presence of the angel Gabrielle, yea, almost healed,
      and how he dared to hope that the evil dreams had yielded. And now the
      sword, as it whizzed round the furious youth, had well-nigh wounded the
      good old man. He stopped short, and clasping his hand, he said, with a
      deep sigh, &ldquo;Alas, Sintram! my foster-child, darling of my heart, what has
      come over thee, thus fearfully stirring thee to rage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth stood awhile as if spell-bound; he looked in his old friend&rsquo;s
      face with a fixed and melancholy gaze, and his eyes became dim, like
      expiring watch-fires seen through a thick cloud of mist. At length he
      sighed forth these words, almost inaudibly: &ldquo;Good Rolf, good Rolf, depart
      from me! thy garden of heaven is no home for me; and if sometimes a light
      breeze blow open its golden gates, so that I can look in and see the
      flowery meadow-land where the dear angels dwell, then straightway between
      them and me come the cold north wind and the icy storm, and the sounding
      doors fly together, and I remain without, lonely, in endless winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beloved young knight, oh, listen to me&mdash;listen to the good angel
      within you! Do you not bear in your hand that very sword with which the
      pure lady girded you? does not her scarf wave over your raging breast? Do
      you not recollect how you used to say, that no man could wish for more
      than had fallen to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Rolf, I have said that,&rdquo; replied Sintram, sinking on the mossy turf,
      bitterly weeping. Tears also ran over the old man&rsquo;s white beard. Before
      long the youth stood again erect, his tears ceased to flow, his looks were
      fearful, cold, and grim; and he said, &ldquo;You see, Rolf, I have passed
      blessed peaceful days, and I thought that the powers of evil would never
      again have dominion over me. So, perchance, it might have been, as day
      would ever be did the Sun ever stand in the sky. But ask the poor
      benighted Earth, wherefore she looks so dark! Bid her again smile as she
      was wont to do! Old man, she cannot smile; and now that the gentle
      compassionate Moon has disappeared behind the clouds with her only funeral
      veil, she cannot even weep. And in this hour of darkness all that is wild
      and mad wakes up. So, stop me not, I tell thee, stop me not! Hurra,
      behind, behind the pale Moon!&rdquo; His voice changed to a hoarse murmur at
      these last words, storm-like. He tore away from the trembling old man, and
      rushed through the forest. Rolf knelt down and prayed, and wept silently.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 12
    </h3>
    <p>
      Where the sea-beach was wildest, and the cliffs most steep and rugged, and
      close by the remains of three shattered oaks, haply marking where, in
      heathen times, human victims had been sacrificed, now stood Sintram,
      leaning, as if exhausted, on his drawn sword, and gazing intently on the
      dancing waves. The moon had again shone forth; and as her pale beams fell
      on his motionless figure through the quivering branches of the trees, he
      might have been taken for some fearful idol-image. Suddenly some one on
      the left half raised himself out of the high withered grass, uttered a
      faint groan, and again lay down. Then between the two companions began
      this strange talk:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou that movest thyself so strangely in the grass, dost thou belong to
      the living or to the dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As one may take it. I am dead to heaven and joy&mdash;I live for hell and
      anguish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Methinks that I have heard thee before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou a troubled spirit? and was thy life-blood poured out here of old
      in sacrifice to idols?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a troubled spirit; but no man ever has, or ever can, shed my blood.
      I have been cast down&mdash;oh, into a frightful abyss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didst thou break there thy neck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live,&mdash;and shall live longer than thou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost thou seemest to me the crazy pilgrim with the dead men&rsquo;s bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not he, though often we are companions,&mdash;ay, walk together
      right near and friendly. But to you be it said, he thinks me mad. If
      sometimes I urge him, and say to him, &lsquo;Take!&rsquo; then he hesitates and points
      upwards towards the stars. And again, if I say, &lsquo;Take not!&rsquo; then, to a
      certainty, he seizes on it in some awkward manner, and so he spoils my
      best joys and pleasures. But, in spite of this, we remain in some measure
      brothers in arms, and, indeed, all but kinsmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me hold of thy hand, and let me help thee to get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho! my active young sir, that might bring you no good. Yet, in fact,
      you have already helped to raise me. Give heed awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilder and ever wilder were the strugglings on the ground; thick clouds
      hurried over the moon and the stars, on a long unknown wild journey; and
      Sintram&rsquo;s thoughts grew no less wild and stormy, while far and near an
      awful howling could be heard amidst the trees and the grass. At length the
      mysterious being arose from the ground. As if with a fearful curiosity,
      the moon, through a rent in the clouds, cast a beam upon Sintram&rsquo;s
      companion, and made clear to the shuddering youth that the little Master
      stood, by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avaunt!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I will listen no more to thy evil stories about the
      knight Paris: they would end by driving me quite mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My stories about Paris are not needed for that!&rdquo; grinned the little
      Master. &ldquo;It is enough that the Helen of thy heart should be journeying
      towards Montfaucon. Believe me, madness has thee already, head and heart.
      Or wouldest thou that she should remain? For that, however, thou must be
      more courteous to me than thou art now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith he raised his voice towards the sea, as if fiercely rebuking it,
      so that Sintram could not but shudder and tremble before the dwarf. But he
      checked himself, and grasping his sword-hilt with both hands, he said,
      contemptuously: &ldquo;Thou and Gabrielle! what acquaintance hast thou with
      Gabrielle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; was the reply. And the little Master might be seen to quake
      with fear and rage as he continued: &ldquo;I cannot well bear the name of thy
      Helen; do not din it in my ears ten times in a breath. But if the tempest
      should increase? If the waves should swell, and roll on till they form a
      foaming ring round the whole coast of Norway? The voyage to Montfaucon
      must in that case be altogether given up, and thy Helen would remain here,
      at least through the long, long, dark winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If! if!&rdquo; replied Sintram, with scorn. &ldquo;Is the sea thy bond-slave? Are the
      storms thy fellow-workmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are rebels, accursed rebels,&rdquo; muttered the little Master in his red
      beard. &ldquo;Thou must lend me thy aid, sir knight, if I am to subdue them; but
      thou hast not the heart for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boaster, evil boaster!&rdquo; answered the youth; &ldquo;what dost thou ask of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, sir knight; nothing at all for one who has strength and ardour
      of soul. Thou needest only look at the sea steadily and keenly for one
      half-hour, without ever ceasing to wish with all thy might that it should
      foam and rage and swell, and never again rest till winter has laid its icy
      hold upon your mountains. Then winter is enough to hinder Duke Menelaus
      from his voyage to Montfaucon. And now give me a lock of your black hair,
      which is blowing so wildly about your head, like ravens&rsquo; or vultures&rsquo; 
      wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth drew his sharp dagger, madly cut off a lock of his hair, threw
      it to the strange being, and now gazed, as he desired, powerfully wishing,
      on the waves of the sea. And softly, quite softly, did the waters stir
      themselves, as one whispers in troubled dreams who would gladly rest and
      cannot. Sintram was on the point of giving up, when in the moonbeams a
      ship appeared, with white-swelling sails, towards the south. Anguish came
      over him, that Gabrielle would soon thus quickly sail away; he wished
      again with all his power, and fixed his eyes intently on the watery abyss.
      &ldquo;Sintram,&rdquo; a voice might have said to him&mdash;&ldquo;ah, Sintram, art thou
      indeed the same who so lately wert gazing on the moistened heaven of the
      eyes of Gabrielle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the waters heaved more mightily, and the howling tempest swept
      over the ocean; the breakers, white with foam, became visible in the
      moonlight. Then the little Master threw the lock of Sintram&rsquo;s hair up
      towards the clouds, and, as it was blown to and fro by the blast of wind,
      the storm burst in all its fury, so that sea and sky were covered with one
      thick cloud, and far off might be heard the cries of distress from many a
      sinking vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the crazy pilgrim with the dead men&rsquo;s bones rose up in the midst of
      the waves, close to the shore, gigantic, tall, fearfully rocking; the boat
      in which he stood was hidden from sight, so mightily raged the waves round
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must save him, little Master&mdash;thou must certainly save him,&rdquo;
       cried Sintram&rsquo;s voice, angrily entreating, through the roaring of the
      winds and waves. But the dwarf replied, with a laugh: &ldquo;Be quite at rest
      for him; he will be able to save himself. The waves can do him no harm.
      Seest thou? They are only begging of him, and therefore they jump up so
      boldly round him; and he gives them bountiful alms&mdash; very bountiful,
      that I can assure thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, as it seemed, the pilgrim threw some bones into the sea, and
      passed scatheless on his way. Sintram felt his blood run cold with horror,
      and he rushed wildly towards the castle. His companion had either fled or
      vanished away.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 13
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the castle, Biorn and Gabrielle and Folko of Montfaucon were sitting
      round the great stone table, from which, since the arrival of his noble
      guests, those suits of armour had been removed, formerly the established
      companions of the lord of the castle, and placed all together in a heap in
      the adjoining room. At this time, while the storm was beating so furiously
      against doors and windows, it seemed as if the ancient armour were also
      stirring in the next room, and Gabrielle several times half rose from her
      seat in great alarm, fixing her eyes on the small iron door, as though she
      expected to see an armed spectre issue therefrom, bending with his mighty
      helmet through the low vaulted doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight Biorn smiled grimly, and said, as if he had guessed her
      thoughts: &ldquo;Oh, he will never again come out thence; I have put an end to
      that for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His guests stared at him doubtingly; and with a strange air of unconcern,
      as though the storm had awakened all the fierceness of his soul, he began
      the following history:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was once a happy man myself; I could smile, as you do, and I could
      rejoice in the morning as you do; that was before the hypocritical
      chaplain had so bewildered the wise mind of my lovely wife with his
      canting talk, that she went into a cloister, and left me alone with our
      wild boy. That was not fair usage from the fair Verena. Well, so it was,
      that in the first days of her dawning beauty, before I knew her, many
      knights sought her hand, amongst whom was Sir Weigand the Slender; and
      towards him the gentle maiden showed herself the most favourably inclined.
      Her parents were well aware that Weigand&rsquo;s rank and station were little
      below their own, and that his early fame as a warrior without reproach
      stood high; so that before long Verena and he were accounted as affianced.
      It happened one day that they were walking together in the orchard, when a
      shepherd was driving his flock up the mountain beyond. The maiden saw a
      little snow-white lamb frolicking gaily, and longed for it. Weigand vaults
      over the railings, overtakes the shepherd, and offers him two gold
      bracelets for the lamb. But the shepherd will not part with it, and
      scarcely listens to the knight, going quietly the while up the
      mountain-side, with Weigand close upon him. At last Weigand loses
      patience. He threatens; and the shepherd, sturdy and proud like all of his
      race in our northern land, threatens in return. Suddenly Weigand&rsquo;s sword
      resounds upon his head,&mdash;the stroke should have fallen flat, but who
      can control a fiery horse or a drawn sword? The bleeding shepherd, with a
      cloven skull, falls down the precipice; his frightened flock bleats on the
      mountain. Only the little lamb runs in its terror to the orchard, pushes
      itself through the garden-rails, and lies at Verena&rsquo;s feet, as if asking
      for help, all red with its master&rsquo;s blood. She took it up in her arms, and
      from that moment never suffered Weigand the Slender to appear again before
      her face. She continued to cherish the little lamb, and seemed to take
      pleasure in nothing else in the world, and became pale and turned towards
      heaven, as the lilies are. She would soon have taken the veil, but just
      then I came to aid her father in a bloody war, and rescued him from his
      enemies. The old man represented this to her, and, softly smiling, she
      gave me her lovely hand. His grief would not suffer the unhappy Weigand to
      remain in his own country. It drove him forth as a pilgrim to Asia, whence
      our forefathers came, and there he did wonderful deeds, both of valour and
      self-abasement. Truly, my heart was strangely weak when I heard him spoken
      of at that time. After some years he returned, and wished to build a
      church or monastery on that mountain towards the west, whence the walls of
      my castle are distinctly seen. It was said that he wished to become a
      priest there, but it fell out otherwise. For some pirates had sailed from
      the southern seas, and, hearing of the building of this monastery, their
      chief thought to find much gold belonging to the lord of the castle and to
      the master builders, or else, if he surprised and carried them off, to
      extort from them a mighty ransom. He did not yet know northern courage and
      northern weapons; but he soon gained that knowledge. Having landed in the
      creek under the black rocks, he made his way through a by-path up to the
      building, surrounded it, and thought in himself that the affair was now
      ended. Ha! then out rushed Weigand and his builders, and fell upon them
      with swords and hatchets and hammers. The heathens fled away to their
      ships, with Weigand behind to take vengeance on them. In passing by our
      castle he caught a sight of Verena on the terrace, and, for the first time
      during so many years, she bestowed a courteous and kind salutation on the
      glowing victor. At that moment a dagger, hurled by one of the pirates in
      the midst of his hasty flight, struck Weigand&rsquo;s uncovered head, and he
      fell to the ground bleeding and insensible. We completed the rout of the
      heathens: then I had the wounded knight brought into the castle; and my
      pale Verena glowed as lilies in the light of the morning sun, and Weigand
      opened his eyes with a smile when he was brought near her. He refused to
      be taken into any room but the small one close to this where the armour is
      now placed; for he said that he felt as if it were a cell like that which
      he hoped soon to inhabit in his quiet cloister. All was done after his
      wish: my sweet Verena nursed him, and he appeared at first to be on the
      straightest road to recovery; but his head continued weak and liable to be
      confused by the slightest emotion, his walk was rather a falling than a
      walking, and his cheeks were colourless. We could not let him go. When we
      were sitting here together in the evening, he used always to come
      tottering into the hall through the low doorway; and my heart was sad and
      wrathful too, when the soft eyes of Verena beamed so sweetly on him, and a
      glow like that of the evening sky hovered over her lily cheeks. But I bore
      it, and I could have borne it to the end of our lives,&mdash;when, alas!
      Verena went into a cloister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head fell so heavily on his folded hands, that the stone table seemed
      to groan beneath it, and he remained a long while motionless as a corpse.
      When he again raised himself up, his eyes glared fearfully as he looked
      round the hall, and he said to Folko: &ldquo;Your beloved Hamburghers, Gotthard
      Lenz, and Rudlieb his son, they have much to answer for! Who bid them come
      and be shipwrecked so close to my castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folko cast a piercing look on him, and a fearful inquiry was on the point
      of escaping his lips, but another look at the trembling Gabrielle made him
      silent, at least for the present moment, and the knight Biorn continued
      his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verena was with her nuns, I was left alone, and my despair had driven me
      throughout the day through forest and brook and mountain. In the twilight
      I returned to my deserted castle, and scarcely was I in the hall, when the
      little door creaked, and Weigand, who had slept through all, crept towards
      me and asked: &lsquo;Where can Verena be?&rsquo; Then I became as mad, and howled to
      him, &lsquo;She is gone mad, and so am I, and you also, and now we are all mad!&rsquo; 
      Merciful Heaven, the wound on his head burst open, and a dark stream
      flowed over his face&mdash;ah! how different from the redness when Verena
      met him at the castle-gate; and he rushed forth, raving mad, into the
      wilderness without, and ever since has wandered all around as a crazy
      pilgrim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, and so were Folko and Gabrielle, all three pale and cold
      like images of the dead. At length the fearful narrator added in a low
      voice, and as if he were quite exhausted: &ldquo;He has visited me since that
      time, but he will never again come through the little door. Have I not
      established peace and order in my castle?&rdquo;
     </p>

      <img src="images/sintram9.jpg" alt="sintram9" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Sintram had not returned home, when those of the castle betook themselves
      to rest in deep bewilderment. No one thought of him, for every heart was
      filled with strange forebodings, and with uncertain cares. Even the heroic
      breast of the Knight of Montfaucon heaved in doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Rolf still remained without, weeping in the forest, heedless of the
      storm which beat on his unprotected head, while he waited for his young
      master. But he had gone a very different way; and when the morning dawned,
      he entered the castle from the opposite side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle&rsquo;s slumbers had been sweet during the whole night. It had seemed
      to her that angels with golden wings had blown away the wild histories of
      the evening before, and had wafted to her the bright flowers, the
      sparkling sea, and the green hills of her own home. She smiled, and drew
      her breath calmly and softly, whilst the magical tempest raged and howled
      through the forests, and continued to battle with the troubled sea. But in
      truth when she awoke in the morning, and heard still the rattling of the
      windows, and saw the clouds, as if dissolved in mist and steam, still
      hiding the face of the heavens, she could have wept for anxiety and
      sadness, especially when she heard from her maidens that Folko had already
      left their apartment clad in full armour as if prepared for a combat. At
      the same time she heard the sound of the heavy tread of armed men in the
      echoing halls, and, on inquiring, found that the Knight of Montfaucon had
      assembled all his retainers to be in readiness to protect their lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrapped in a cloak of ermine, she stood trembling like a tender flower
      just sprung up out of the snow, tottering beneath a winter&rsquo;s storm. Then
      Sir Folko entered the room, in all his shining armour, and peacefully
      carrying his golden helmet with the long shadowy plumes in his hand. He
      saluted Gabrielle with cheerful serenity, and at a sign from him, her
      attendants retired, while the men-at-arms without were heard quietly
      dispersing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, as he took his seat beside her, on a couch to which he
      led her, already re-assured by his presence: &ldquo;lady, will you forgive your
      knight for having left you to endure some moments of anxiety; but honour
      and stern justice called him. Now all is set in order, quietly and
      peacefully; dismiss your fears and every thought that has troubled you, as
      things which are no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you and Biorn?&rdquo; asked Gabrielle. &ldquo;On the word of a knight,&rdquo; replied
      he, &ldquo;all is well there.&rdquo; And thereupon he began to talk over indifferent
      subjects with his usual ease and wit; but Gabrielle, bending towards him,
      said with deep emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Folko, my knight, the flower of my life, my protector and my dearest
      hope on earth, tell me all, if thou mayst. But if a promise binds thee, it
      is different. Thou knowest that I am of the race of Portamour, and I would
      ask nothing from my knight which could cast even a breath of suspicion on
      his spotless shield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folko thought gravely for one instant; then looking at her with a bright
      smile, he said: &ldquo;It is not that, Gabrielle; but canst thou bear what I
      have to disclose? Wilt thou not sink down under it, as a slender fir gives
      way under a mass of snow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised herself somewhat proudly, and said: &ldquo;I have already reminded
      thee of the name of my father&rsquo;s house. Let me now add, that I am the
      wedded wife of the Baron of Montfaucon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then so let it be,&rdquo; replied Folko solemnly; &ldquo;and if that must come forth
      openly which should ever have remained hidden in the darkness which
      belongs to such deeds of wickedness, at least let it come forth less
      fearfully with a sudden flash. Know then, Gabrielle, that the wicked
      knight who would have slain my friends Gotthard and Rudlieb is none other
      than our kinsman and host, Biorn of the Fiery Eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle shuddered and covered her eyes with her fair hands; but at the
      end of a moment she looked up with a bewildered air, and said: &ldquo;I have
      heard wrong surely, although it is true that yesterday evening such a
      thought struck me. For did not you say awhile ago that all was settled and
      at peace between you and Biorn? Between the brave baron and such a man
      after such a crime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard aright,&rdquo; answered Folko, looking with fond delight on the
      delicate yet high-minded lady. &ldquo;This morning with the earliest dawn I went
      to him and challenged him to a mortal combat in the neighbouring valley,
      if he were the man whose castle had well-nigh become an altar of sacrifice
      to Gotthard and Rudlieb. He was already completely armed, and merely
      saying, &lsquo;I am he,&rsquo; he followed me to the forest. But when he stood alone
      at the place of combat, he flung away his shield down a giddy precipice,
      then his sword was hurled after it, and next with gigantic strength he
      tore off his coat of mail, and said, &lsquo;Now fall on, thou minister of
      vengeance; for I am a heavy sinner, and I dare not fight with thee.&rsquo; How
      could I then attack him? A strange truce was agreed on between us. He is
      half as my vassal, and yet I solemnly forgave him in my own name and in
      that of my friends. He was contrite, and yet no tear was in his eye, no
      gentle word on his lips. He is only kept under by the power with which I
      am endued by having right on my side, and it is on that tenure that Biorn
      is my vassal. I know not, lady, whether you can bear to see us together on
      these terms; if not, I will ask for hospitality in some other castle;
      there are none in Norway which would not receive us joyfully and
      honourably, and this wild autumnal storm may put off our voyage for many a
      day. Only this I think, that if we depart directly and in such a manner,
      the heart of this savage man will break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where my noble lord remains, there I also remain joyfully under his
      protection,&rdquo; replied Gabrielle; and again her heart glowed with rapture at
      the greatness of her knight.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 15
    </h3>
    <p>
      The noble lady had just unbuckled her knight&rsquo;s armour with her own fair
      hands,&mdash;on the field of battle alone were pages or esquires bidden
      handle Montfaucon&rsquo;s armour,&mdash;and now she was throwing over his
      shoulders his mantle of blue velvet embroidered with gold, when the door
      opened gently, and Sintram entered the room, humbly greeting them.
      Gabrielle received him kindly, as she was wont, but suddenly turning pale,
      she looked away and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Sintram, what has happened to you? And how can one single night have so
      fearfully altered you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram stood still, thunderstruck, and feeling as if he himself did not
      know what had befallen him. Then Folko took him by the hand, led him
      towards a bright polished shield, and said very earnestly, &ldquo;Look here at
      yourself, young knight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first glance Sintram drew back horrified. He fancied that he saw
      the little Master before him with that single upright feather sticking out
      of his cap; but he at length perceived that the mirror was only showing
      him his own image and none other, and that his own wild dagger had given
      him this strange and spectre-like aspect, as he could not deny to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has done that to you?&rdquo; asked Folko, yet more grave and solemn. &ldquo;And
      what terror makes your disordered hair stand on end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram knew not what to answer. He felt as if a judgment were coming on
      him, and a shameful degrading from his knightly rank. Suddenly Folko drew
      him away from the shield, and taking him towards the rattling window, he
      asked: &ldquo;Whence comes this tempest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Sintram kept silence. His limbs began to tremble under him; and
      Gabrielle, pale and terrified, whispered, &ldquo;O Folko, my knight, what has
      happened? Oh, tell me; are we come into an enchanted castle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The land of our northern ancestors,&rdquo; replied Folko with solemnity, &ldquo;is
      full of mysterious knowledge. But we may not, for all that, call its
      people enchanters; still this youth has cause to watch himself narrowly;
      he whom the evil one has touched by so much as one hair of his head. . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram heard no more; with a deep groan he staggered out of the room. As
      he left it, he met old Rolf, still almost benumbed by the cold and storms
      of the night. Now, in his joy at again seeing his young master, he did not
      remark his altered appearance; but as he accompanied him to his
      sleeping-room he said, &ldquo;Witches and spirits of the tempest must have taken
      up their abode on the sea-shore. I am certain that such wild storms never
      arise without some devilish arts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram fell into a fainting-fit, from which Rolf could with difficulty
      recover him sufficiently to appear in the great hall at the mid-day hour.
      But before he went down, he caused a shield to be brought, saw himself
      therein, and cut close round, in grief and horror, the rest of his long
      black hair, so that he made himself look almost like a monk; and thus he
      joined the others already assembled round the table. They all looked at
      him with surprise; but old Biorn rose up and said fiercely, &ldquo;Are you going
      to betake yourself to the cloister, as well as the fair lady your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A commanding look from the Baron of Montfaucon checked any further
      outbreak; and as if in apology, Biorn added, with a forced smile, &ldquo;I was
      only thinking if any accident had befallen him, like Absalom&rsquo;s, and if he
      had been obliged to save himself from being strangled by parting with all
      his hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not jest with holy things,&rdquo; answered the baron severely, and
      all were silent. No sooner was the repast ended, than Folko and Gabrielle,
      with a grave and courteous salutation, retired to their apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkChapter16" id="linkChapter16"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAPTER 16
    </h3>
    <p>
      Life in the castle took from this time quite another form. Those two
      bright beings, Folko and Gabrielle, spent most part of the day in their
      apartments, and when they showed themselves, it was with quiet dignity and
      grave silence, while Biorn and Sintram stood before them in humble fear.
      Nevertheless, Biorn could not bear the thought of his guests seeking
      shelter in any other knight&rsquo;s abode. When Folko once spoke of it,
      something like a tear stood in the wild man&rsquo;s eye. His head sank, and he
      said softly, &ldquo;As you please; but I feel that if you go, I shall run among
      the rocks for days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus they all remained together; for the storm continued to rage with
      such increasing fury over the sea, that no sea voyage could be thought of,
      and the oldest man in Norway could not call to mind such an autumn. The
      priests examined all the runic books, the bards looked through their lays
      and tales, and yet they could find no record of the like. Biorn and
      Sintram braved the tempest; but during the few hours in which Folko and
      Gabrielle showed themselves, the father and son were always in the castle,
      as if respectfully waiting upon them; the rest of the day&mdash;nay, often
      through whole nights, they rushed through the forests and over the rocks
      in pursuit of bears. Folko the while called up all the brightness of his
      fancy, all his courtly grace, in order to make Gabrielle forget that she
      was living in this wild castle, and that the long, hard northern winter
      was setting in, which would ice them in for many a month. Sometimes he
      would relate bright tales; then he would play the liveliest airs to induce
      Gabrielle to lead a dance with her attendants; then, again, handing his
      lute to one of the women, he would himself take a part the dance, well
      knowing to express thereby after some new fashion his devotion to his
      lady. Another time he would have the spacious halls of the castle prepared
      for his armed retainers to go through their warlike exercises, and
      Gabrielle always adjudged the reward to the conqueror. Folko often joined
      the circle of combatants; so that he only met their attacks, defending
      himself, but depriving no one of the prize. The Norwegians, who stood
      around as spectators, used to compare him to the demi-god Baldur, one of
      the heroes of their old traditions, who was wont to let the darts of his
      companions be all hurled against him, conscious that he was invulnerable,
      and of his own indwelling strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of one of these martial exercises, old Rolf advanced towards
      Folko, and beckoning him with an humble look, said softly, &ldquo;They call you
      the beautiful mighty Baldur,&mdash;and they are right. But even the
      beautiful mighty Baldur did not escape death. Take heed to yourself.&rdquo;
       Folko looked at him wondering. &ldquo;Not that I know of any treachery,&rdquo;
       continued the old man; &ldquo;or that I can even foresee the likelihood of any.
      God keep a Norwegian from such a fear. But when you stand before me in all
      the brightness of your glory, the fleetingness of everything earthly
      weighs down my mind, and I cannot refrain from saying, &lsquo;Take heed, noble
      baron! oh, take heed! Even the most beautiful glory comes to an end.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are wise and pious thoughts,&rdquo; replied Folko calmly, &ldquo;and I will
      treasure them in a pure heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good Rolf was often with Folko and Gabrielle, and made a connecting
      link between the two widely differing parties in the castle. For how could
      he have ever forsaken his own Sintram! Only in the wild hunting
      expeditions through the howling storms and tempests he no longer was able
      to follow his young lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the icy reign of winter began in all its glory. On this account
      a return to Normandy was impossible, and therefore the magical storm was
      lulled. The hills and valleys shone brilliantly in their white attire of
      snow, and Folko used sometimes, with skates on his feet, to draw his lady
      in a light sledge over the glittering frozen lakes and streams. On the
      other hand, the bear-hunts of the lord of the castle and his son took a
      still more desperate and to them joyous course.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time,&mdash;when Christmas was drawing near, and Sintram was
      seeking to overpower his dread of the awful dreams by the most daring
      expeditions,&mdash;about this time, Folko and Gabrielle stood together on
      one of the terraces of the castle. The evening was mild; the snow- clad
      fields were glowing in the red light of the setting sun; from below there
      were heard men&rsquo;s voices singing songs of ancient heroic times, while they
      worked in the armourer&rsquo;s forge. At last the songs died away, the beating
      of hammers ceased, and, without the speakers being seen, or there being
      any possibility of distinguishing them by their voices, the following
      discourse arose:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the bravest amongst all those whose race derives its origin from
      our renowned land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Folko of Montfaucon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rightly said; but tell me, is there anything from which even this bold
      baron draws back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth there is one thing,&mdash;and we who have never left Norway face
      it quite willingly and joyfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bear-hunt in winter, over trackless plains of snow, down frightful
      ice-covered precipices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly thou answerest aright, my comrade. He who knows not how to fasten
      our skates on his feet, how to turn in them to the right or left at a
      moment&rsquo;s warning, he may be a valiant knight in other respects, but he had
      better keep away from our hunting parties, and remain with his timid wife
      in her apartments.&rdquo; At which the speakers were heard to laugh well
      pleased, and then to betake themselves again to their armourer&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folko stood long buried in thought. A glow beyond that of the evening sky
      reddened his cheek. Gabrielle also remained silent, considering she knew
      not what. At last she took courage, and embracing her beloved, she said:
      &ldquo;To-morrow thou wilt go forth to hunt the bear, wilt thou not? and thou
      wilt bring the spoils of the chase to thy lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight gave a joyful sign of assent; and the rest of the evening was
      spent in dances and music.
    </p>

      CHAPTER 17
    </h3>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram11.jpg" alt="sintram11" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, my noble lord,&rdquo; said Sintram the next morning, when Folko had
      expressed his wish of going out with him, &ldquo;these skates of ours give such
      wings to our course, that we go down the mountain-side swiftly as the
      wind; and even in going up again we are too quick for any one to be able
      to pursue us, and on the plains no horse can keep up with us; and yet they
      can only be worn with safety by those who are well practised. It seems as
      though some strange spirit dwelt in them, which is fearfully dangerous to
      any that have not learnt the management of them in their childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folko answered somewhat proudly: &ldquo;Do you suppose that this is the first
      time that I have been amongst your mountains? Years ago I have joined in
      this sport, and, thank Heaven, there is no knightly exercise which does
      not speedily become familiar to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram did not venture to make any further objections, and still less did
      old Biorn. They both felt relieved when they saw with what skill and ease
      Folko buckled the skates on his feet, without suffering any one to assist
      him. This day they hunted up the mountain in pursuit of a fierce bear
      which had often before escaped from them. Before long it was necessary
      that they should separate, and Sintram offered himself as companion to
      Folko, who, touched by the humble manner of the youth, and his devotion to
      him, forgot all that had latterly seemed mysterious in the pale altered
      being before him, and agreed heartily. As now they continued to climb
      higher and higher up the mountain, and saw from many a giddy height the
      rocks and crags below them looking like a vast expanse of sea suddenly
      turned into ice whilst tossed by a violent tempest, the noble Montfaucon
      drew his breath more freely. He poured forth war-songs and love-longs in
      the clear mountain air, and the startled echoes repeated from rock to rock
      the lays of his Frankish home. He sprang lightly from one precipice to
      another, using strongly and safely his staff for support, and turning now
      to the right, now to the left, as the fancy seized him; so that Sintram
      was fain to exchange his former anxiety for a wondering admiration, and
      the hunters, whose eyes had never been taken off the baron, burst forth
      with loud applause, proclaiming far and wide fresh glory of their guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good fortune which usually accompanied Folko&rsquo;s deeds of arms seemed
      still unwilling to leave him. After a short search, he and Sintram found
      distinct traces of the savage animal, and with beating hearts they
      followed the track so swiftly that even a winged enemy would have been
      unable to escape from them. But the creature whom they sought did not
      attempt a flight&mdash;he lay sulkily in a cavern near the top of a steep
      precipitous rock, infuriated by the shouts of the hunters, and only
      waiting in his lazy fury for some one to be bold enough to climb up to his
      retreat, that he might tear him to pieces. Folko and Sintram had now
      reached the foot of this rock, the rest of the hunters being dispersed
      over the far-extending plain. The track led the two companions up the
      rock, and they set about climbing on the opposite sides of it, that they
      might be the more sure of not missing their prey. Folko reached the lonely
      topmost point first, and cast his eyes around. A wide, boundless tract of
      country, covered with untrodden snow, was spread before him, melting in
      the distance into the lowering clouds of the gloomy evening sky. He almost
      thought that he must have missed the traces of the fearful beast; when
      close beside him from a cleft in the rock issued a long growl, and a huge
      black bear appeared on the snow, standing on its hind legs, and with
      glaring eyes it advanced towards the baron. Sintram the while was
      struggling in vain to make his way up the rock against the masses of snow
      continually slipping down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyful at a combat so long untried as almost to be new, Folko of
      Montfaucon levelled his hunting spear, and awaited the attack of the wild
      beast. He suffered it to approach so near that its fearful claws were
      almost upon him; then he made a thrust, and the spear-head was buried deep
      in the bear&rsquo;s breast. But the furious beast still pressed on with a fierce
      growl, kept up on its hind legs by the cross-iron of the spear, and the
      knight was forced to plant his feet deep in the earth to resist the savage
      assault; and ever close before him the grim and bloody face of the bear,
      and close in his ear its deep savage growl, wrung forth partly by the
      agony of death, partly by thirst for blood. At length the bear&rsquo;s
      resistance grew weaker, and the dark blood streamed freely upon the snow;
      he tottered; and one powerful thrust hurled him backwards over the edge of
      the precipice. At the same instant Sintram stood by the Baron of
      Montfaucon. Folko said, drawing a deep breath: &ldquo;But I have not yet the
      prize in my hands, and have it I must, since fortune has given me a claim
      to it. Look, one of my skates seems to be out of order. Thinkest thou,
      Sintram, that it holds enough to slide down to the foot of the precipice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go instead,&rdquo; said Sintram. &ldquo;I will bring you the head and the
      claws of the bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A true knight,&rdquo; replied Folko, with some displeasure, &ldquo;never does a
      knightly deed by halves. What I ask is, whether my skate will still hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Sintram bent down to look, and was on the point of saying &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he
      suddenly heard a voice close to him, saying, &ldquo;Why, yes, to be sure; there
      is no doubt about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folko thought that Sintram had spoken, and slid down with the swiftness of
      an arrow, whilst his companion looked up in great surprise. The hated form
      of the little Master met his eyes. As he was going to address him with
      angry words, he heard the sound of the baron&rsquo;s fearful fall, and he stood
      still in silent horror. There was a breathless silence also in the abyss
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why dost thou delay?&rdquo; said the little Master, after a pause. &ldquo;He is
      dashed to pieces. Go back to the castle, and take the fair Helen to
      thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram shuddered. Then his hateful companion began to praise Gabrielle&rsquo;s
      charms in so glowing, deceiving words, that the heart of the youth swelled
      with emotions he had never before known. He only thought of him who was
      now lying at the foot of the rock as of an obstacle removed between him
      and heaven: he turned towards the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a cry was heard below: &ldquo;Help! help! my comrade! I am yet alive, but I
      am sorely wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram&rsquo;s will was changed, and he called to the baron, &ldquo;I am coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the little Master said, &ldquo;Nothing can be done to help Duke Menelaus;
      and the fair Helen knows it already. She is only waiting for knight Paris
      to comfort her.&rdquo; And with detestable craft he wove in that tale with what
      was actually happening, bringing in the most highly wrought praises of the
      lovely Gabrielle; and alas! the dazzled youth yielded to him, and fled!
      Again he heard far off the baron&rsquo;s voice calling to him, &ldquo;Knight Sintram,
      knight Sintram, thou on whom I bestowed the holy order, haste to me and
      help me! The she-bear and her whelps will be upon me, and I cannot use my
      right arm! Knight Sintram, knight Sintram, haste to help me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His cries were overpowered by the furious speed with which the two were
      carried along on their skates, and by the evil words of the little Master,
      who was mocking at the late proud bearing of Duke Menelaus towards the
      poor Sintram. At last he shouted, &ldquo;Good luck to you, she-bear! good luck
      to your whelps! There is a glorious meal for you! Now you will feed upon
      the fear of Heathendom, him at whose name the Moorish brides weep, the
      mighty Baron of Montfaucon. Never again, O dainty knight, will you shout
      at the head of your troops, &lsquo;Mountjoy St. Denys!&rsquo;&rdquo; But scarce had this
      holy name passed the lips of the little Master, than he set up a howl of
      anguish, writhing himself with horrible contortions, and wringing his
      hands, and ended by disappearing in a storm of snow which then arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram planted his staff firmly in the ground, and stopped. How strangely
      did the wide expanse of snow, the distant mountains rising above it, and
      the dark green fir-woods&mdash;how strangely did they all look at him in
      cold reproachful silence! He felt as if he must sink under the weight of
      his sorrow and his guilt. The bell of a distant hermitage came floating
      sadly over the plain. With a burst of tears he exclaimed, as the darkness
      grew thicker round him, &ldquo;My mother! my mother! I had once a beloved tender
      mother, and she said I was a good child!&rdquo; A ray of comfort came to him as
      if brought on an angel&rsquo;s wing; perhaps Montfaucon was not yet dead! and he
      flew like lightning along the path, back to the steep rock. When he got to
      the fearful place, he stooped and looked anxiously down the precipice. The
      moon, just risen in full majesty, helped him. The Knight of Montfaucon,
      pale and bleeding, was half kneeling against the rock; his right arm,
      crushed in his fall, hung powerless at his side; it was plain that he
      could not draw his good sword out of the scabbard. But nevertheless he was
      keeping the bear and her young ones at bay by his bold threatening looks,
      so that they only crept round him, growling angrily; every moment ready
      for a fierce attack, but as often driven back affrighted at the majestic
      air by which he conquered even when defenceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a hero would there have perished!&rdquo; groaned Sintram, &ldquo;and through
      whose guilt?&rdquo; In an instant his spear flew with so true an aim that the
      bear fell weltering in her blood; the young ones ran away howling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron looked up with surprise. His countenance beamed as the light of
      the moon fell upon it, grave and stern, yet mild, like some angelic
      vision. &ldquo;Come down!&rdquo; he beckoned; and Sintram slid down the side of the
      precipice, full of anxious haste. He was going to attend to the wounded
      man, but Folko said, &ldquo;First cut off the head and claws of the bear which I
      slew. I promised to bring the spoils of the chase to my lovely Gabrielle.
      Then come to me, and bind up my wounds. My right arm is broken.&rdquo; Sintram
      obeyed the baron&rsquo;s commands. When the tokens of victory had been secured,
      and the broken arm bound up, Folko desired the youth to help him back to
      the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Heavens!&rdquo; said Sintram in a low voice, &ldquo;if I dared to look in your
      face! or only knew how to come near you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou wert indeed going on in an evil course,&rdquo; said Montfaucon, gravely;
      &ldquo;but how could we, any of us, stand before God, did not repentance help
      us? At any rate, thou hast now saved my life, and let that thought cheer
      thy heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth with tenderness and strength supported the baron&rsquo;s left arm, and
      they both went their way silently in the moonlight.

    </div>
    <p>
      Sounds of wailing were heard from the castle as they approached; the
      chapel was solemnly lighted up; within it knelt Gabrielle, lamenting for
      the death of the Knight of Montfaucon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how quickly was all changed, when the noble baron, pale indeed, and
      bleeding, yet having escaped all mortal danger, stood smiling at the
      entrance of the holy building, and said, in a low, gentle voice, &ldquo;Look up,
      Gabrielle, and be not affrighted; for, by the honour of my race, thy
      knight still lives.&rdquo; Oh! with what joy did Gabrielle&rsquo;s eyes sparkle, as
      she turned to her knight, and then raised them again to heaven, still
      streaming, but from the deep source of thankful joy! With the help of two
      pages, Folko knelt down beside her, and they both sanctified their
      happiness with a silent prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they left the chapel, the wounded knight being tenderly supported by
      his lady, Sintram was standing without in the darkness, himself as gloomy
      as the night, and, like a bird of the night, shunning the sight of men.
      Yet he came trembling forward into the torch-light, laid the bear&rsquo;s head
      and claws at the feet of Gabrielle, and said, &ldquo;The noble Folko of
      Montfaucon presents the spoils of to- day&rsquo;s chase to his lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Norwegians burst forth with shouts of joyful surprise at the stranger
      knight, who in the very first hunting expedition had slain the most
      fearful and dangerous beast of their mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Folko looked around with a smile as he said, &ldquo;And now none of you
      must jeer at me, if I stay at home for a short time with my timid wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who the day before had talked together in the armourer&rsquo;s forge came
      out from the crowd, and bowing low, they replied, &ldquo;Noble baron, who could
      have thought that there was no knightly exercise in the whole world in the
      which you would not show yourself far above all other men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pupil of old Sir Hugh may be somewhat trusted,&rdquo; answered Folko
      kindly. &ldquo;But now, you bold northern warriors, bestow some praises also on
      my deliverer, who saved me from the claws of the she-bear, when I was
      leaning against the rock wounded by my fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to Sintram, and the general shout was again raised; and old
      Rolf, with tears of joy in his eyes, bent his head over his foster-son&rsquo;s
      hand. But Sintram drew back shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you but know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whom you see before you, all your spears
      would be aimed at my heart; and perhaps that would be the best thing for
      me. But I spare the honour of my father and of his race, and for this time
      I will not confess. Only this much must you know, noble warriors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; interrupted Folko with a reproving look, &ldquo;already again so
      wild and fierce? I desire that thou wilt hold thy peace about thy dreaming
      fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram was silenced for a moment; but hardly had Folko begun smilingly to
      move towards the steps of the castle, than he cried out, &ldquo;Oh, no, no,
      noble wounded knight, stay yet awhile; I will serve thee in everything
      that thy heart can desire; but herein I cannot serve thee. Brave warriors,
      you must and shall know so much as this; I am no longer worthy to live
      under the same roof with the noble Baron of Montfaucon and his angelic
      wife Gabrielle. And you, my aged father, good-night; long not for me. I
      intend to live in the stone fortress on the Rocks of the Moon, till a
      change of some kind come over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was that in his way of speaking against which no one dared to set
      himself, not even Folko.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild Biorn bowed his head humbly, and said, &ldquo;Do according to thy
      pleasure, my poor son; for I fear that thou art right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Sintram walked solemnly and silently through the castle-gate,
      followed by the good Rolf. Gabrielle led her exhausted lord up to their
      apartments.
    </p>

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 19
    </h3>
    <p>
      That was a mournful journey on which the youth and his aged foster- father
      went towards the Rocks of the Moon, through the wild tangled paths of the
      snow-clad valleys. Rolf from time to time sang some verses of hymns, in
      which comfort and peace were promised to the penitent sinner, and Sintram
      thanked him for them with looks of grateful sadness. Neither of them spoke
      a word else.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when the dawn of day was approaching, Sintram broke silence by
      saying, &ldquo;Who are those two sitting yonder by the frozen stream&mdash;a
      tall man and a little one? Their own wild hearts must have driven them
      also forth into the wilderness. Rolf, dost thou know them? The sight of
      them makes me shudder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram15.jpg" alt="sintram15" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered the old man, &ldquo;your disturbed mind deceives you. There
      stands a lofty fir-tree, and the old weather-beaten stump of an oak,
      half-covered with snow, which gives them a somewhat strange appearance.
      There are no men sitting yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Rolf, look there! look again carefully! Now they move, they whisper
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, the morning breeze moves the branches, and whistles in the sharp
      pine-leaves and in the yellow oak-leaves, and rustles the crisp snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rolf, now they are both coming towards us. Now they are standing before
      us, quite close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is we who get nearer to them as we walk on, and the setting moon
      throws such long giant-like shadows over the plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening!&rdquo; said a hollow voice; and Sintram knew it was the crazy
      pilgrim, near to whom stood the malignant little Master, looking more
      hideous than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir knight,&rdquo; whispered Rolf, as he drew back behind
      Sintram, and made the Sign of the Cross on his breast and his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bewildered youth, however, advanced towards the two figures, and said,
      &ldquo;You have always taken wonderful pleasure in being my companions. What do
      you expect will come of it? And do you choose to go now with me to the
      stone fortress? There I will tend thee, poor pale pilgrim; and as to thee,
      frightful Master, most evil dwarf, I will make thee shorter by the head,
      to reward thee for thy deeds yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a fine thing,&rdquo; sneered the little Master; &ldquo;and perhaps thou
      imaginest that thou wouldst be doing a great service to the whole world?
      And, indeed, who knows? Something might be gained by it! Only, poor
      wretch, thou canst not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim meantime was waving his pale head to and fro thoughtfully,
      saying, &ldquo;I believe truly that thou wouldst willingly have me, and I would
      go to thee willingly, but I may not yet. Have patience awhile; thou wilt
      yet surely see me come, but at a distant time; and first we must again
      visit thy father together, and then also thou wilt learn to call me by my
      right name, my poor friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of disappointing me again!&rdquo; said the little Master to the pilgrim
      in a threatening voice; but he, pointing with his long, shrivelled hand
      towards the sun, which was just now rising, said, &ldquo;Stop either that sun or
      me, if thou canst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the first rays fell on the snow, and the little Master ran,
      muttering, down a precipice; but the pilgrim walked on in the bright
      beams, calmly and with great solemnity, towards a neighbouring castle on
      the mountain. It was not long before its chapel-bell was heard tolling for
      the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; whispered the good Rolf to his knight&mdash;&ldquo;for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Sir Sintram, what kind of companions have you here? One of
      them cannot bear the light of God&rsquo;s blessed sun, and the other has no
      sooner set foot in a dwelling than tidings of death wail after his track.
      Could he have been a murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that,&rdquo; said Sintram. &ldquo;He seemed to me the best of the two.
      But it is a strange wilfulness of his not to come with me. Did I not
      invite him kindly? I believe that he can sing well, and he should have
      sung to me some gentle lullaby. Since my mother has lived in a cloister,
      no one sings lullabies to me any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this tender recollection his eyes were bedewed with tears. But he did
      not himself know what he had said besides, for there was wildness and
      confusion in his spirit. They arrived at the Rocks of the Moon, and
      mounted up to the stone fortress. The castellan, an old, gloomy man, the
      more devoted to the young knight from his dark melancholy and wild deeds,
      hastened to lower the drawbridge. Greetings were exchanged in silence, and
      in silence did Sintram enter, and those joyless gates closed with a crash
      behind the future recluse.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkChapter20" id="linkChapter20"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAPTER 20
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes truly, a recluse, or at least something like it, did poor Sintram now
      become! For towards the time of the approaching Christmas festival his
      fearful dreams came over him, and seized him so fiercely, that all the
      esquires and servants fled with shrieks out of the castle, and would never
      venture back again. No one remained with him except Rolf and the old
      castellan. After a while, indeed, Sintram became calm, but he went about
      looking so pallid and still that he might have been taken for a wandering
      corpse. No comforting of the good Rolf, no devout soothing lays, were of
      any avail; and the castellan, with his fierce, scarred features, his head
      almost entirely bald from a huge sword-cut, his stubborn silence, seemed
      like a yet darker shadow of the miserable knight. Rolf often thought of
      going to summon the holy chaplain of Drontheim; but how could he have left
      his lord alone with the gloomy castellan, a man who at all times raised in
      him a secret horror? Biorn had long had this wild strange warrior in his
      service, and honoured him on account of his unshaken fidelity and his
      fearless courage, though neither the knight nor any one else knew whence
      the castellan came, nor, indeed, exactly who he was. Very few people knew
      by what name to call him; but that was the more needless, since he never
      entered into discourse with any one. He was the castellan of the stone
      fortress on the Rocks of the Moon, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolf committed his deep heartfelt cares to the merciful God, trusting that
      he would soon come to his aid; and the merciful God did not fail him. For
      on Christmas eve the bell at the drawbridge sounded, and Rolf, looking
      over the battlements, saw the chaplain of Drontheim standing there, with a
      companion indeed that surprised him,&mdash;for close beside him appeared
      the crazy pilgrim, and the dead men&rsquo;s bones on his dark mantle shone very
      strangely in the glimmering starlight: but the sight of the chaplain
      filled the good Rolf too full of joy to leave room for any doubt in his
      mind; for, thought he, whoever comes with him cannot but be welcome! And
      so he let them both in with respectful haste, and ushered them up to the
      hall, where Sintram, pale and with a fixed look, was sitting under the
      light of one flickering lamp. Rolf was obliged to support and assist the
      crazy pilgrim up the stairs, for he was quite benumbed with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring you a greeting from your mother,&rdquo; said the chaplain as he came
      in; and immediately a sweet smile passed over the young knight&rsquo;s
      countenance, and its deadly pallidness gave place to a bright soft glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Heaven!&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;does then my mother yet live, and does she care
      to know anything about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is endowed with a wonderful presentiment of the future,&rdquo; replied the
      chaplain; &ldquo;and all that you ought either to do or to leave undone is
      faithfully mirrored in various ways in her mind, during a half- waking
      trance. Now she knows of your deep sorrow, and she sends me, the
      father-confessor of her convent, to comfort you, but at the same time to
      warn you; for, as she affirms, and as I am also inclined to think, many
      strange and heavy trials lie before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram bowed himself towards the chaplain with his arms crossed over his
      breast, and said, with a gentle smile, &ldquo;Much have I been favoured&mdash;more,
      a thousand times more, than I could have dared to hope in my best hours&mdash;by
      this greeting from my mother, and your visit, reverend sir; and all after
      falling more fearfully low than I had ever fallen before. The mercy of the
      Lord is great; and how heavy soever may be the weight and punishment which
      He may send, I trust, with His grace, to be able to bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door opened, and the castellan came in with a torch in his
      hand, the red glare of which made his face look the colour of blood. He
      cast a terrified glance at the crazy pilgrim, who had just sunk back in a
      swoon, and was supported on his seat and tended by Rolf; then he stared
      with astonishment at the chaplain, and at last murmured, &ldquo;A strange
      meeting! I believe that the hour for confession and reconciliation is now
      arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so too,&rdquo; replied the priest, who had heard his low whisper;
      &ldquo;this seems to be truly a day rich in grace and peace. That poor man
      yonder, whom I found half-frozen by the way, would make a full confession
      to me at once, before he followed me to a place of shelter. Do as he has
      done, my dark-browed warrior, and delay not your good purpose for one
      instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he left the room with the willing castellan, but he turned back
      to say, &ldquo;Sir Knight and your esquire! take good care the while of my sick
      charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram and Rolf did according to the chaplain&rsquo;s desire: and when at
      length their cordials made the pilgrim open his eyes once again, the young
      knight said to him, with a friendly smile, &ldquo;Seest thou? thou art come to
      visit me after all. Why didst thou refuse me when, a few nights ago, I
      asked thee so earnestly to come? Perhaps I may have spoken wildly and
      hastily. Did that scare thee away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden expression of fear came over the pilgrim&rsquo;s countenance; but soon
      he again looked up at Sintram with an air of gentle humility, saying, &ldquo;O
      my dear, dear lord, I am most entirely devoted to you&mdash; only never
      speak to me of former passages between you and me. I am terrified whenever
      you do it. For, my lord, either I am mad and have forgotten all that is
      past, or that Being has met you in the wood, whom I look upon as my very
      powerful twin brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram laid his hand gently on the pilgrim&rsquo;s mouth, as he answered, &ldquo;Say
      nothing more about that matter: I most willingly promise to be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither he nor old Rolf could understand what appeared to them so awful in
      the whole matter; but both shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short pause the pilgrim said, &ldquo;I would rather sing you a song&mdash;a
      soft, comforting song. Have you not a lute here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rolf fetched one; and the pilgrim, half-raising himself on the couch, sang
      the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When death is coming near,<br /> When thy heart shrinks in fear<br /> And
      thy limbs fail,<br /> Then raise thy hands and pray<br /> To Him who smooths
      thy way<br /> Through the dark vale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seest thou the eastern dawn,<br /> Hearst thou in the red morn<br /> The
      angel&rsquo;s song?<br /> Oh, lift thy drooping head,<br /> Thou who in gloom and
      dread<br /> Hast lain so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death comes to set thee free;<br /> Oh, meet him cheerily<br /> As thy true
      friend,<br /> And all thy fears shall cease,<br /> And in eternal peace<br />
      Thy penance end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Sintram and Rolf, folding their hands; and whilst the last
      chords of the lute still resounded, the chaplain and the castellan came
      slowly and gently into the room. &ldquo;I bring a precious Christmas gift,&rdquo; said
      the priest. &ldquo;After many sad years, hope of reconciliation and peace of
      conscience are returning to a noble, disturbed mind. This concerns thee,
      beloved pilgrim; and do thou, my Sintram, with a joyful trust in God, take
      encouragement and example from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than twenty years ago,&rdquo; began the castellan, at a sign from the
      chaplain&mdash;&ldquo;more than twenty years ago I was a bold shepherd, driving
      my flock up the mountains. A young knight followed me, whom they called
      Weigand the Slender. He wanted to buy of me my favourite little lamb for
      his fair bride, and offered me much red gold for it. I sturdily refused.
      Over-bold youth boiled up in us both. A stroke of his sword hurled me
      senseless down the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not killed?&rdquo; asked the pilgrim in a scarce audible voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no ghost,&rdquo; replied the castellan, somewhat morosely; and then, after
      an earnest look from the priest, he continued, more humbly: &ldquo;I recovered
      slowly and in solitude, with the help of remedies which were easily found
      by me, a shepherd, in our productive valleys. When I came back into the
      world, no man knew me, with my scarred face, and my now bald head. I heard
      a report going through the country, that on account of this deed of his,
      Sir Weigand the Slender had been rejected by his fair betrothed Verena,
      and how he had pined away, and she had wished to retire into a convent,
      but her father had persuaded her to marry the great knight Biorn. Then
      there came a fearful thirst for vengeance into my heart, and I disowned my
      name, and my kindred, and my home, and entered the service of the mighty
      Biorn, as a strange wild man, in order that Weigand the Slender should
      always remain a murderer, and that I might feed on his anguish. So have I
      fed upon it for all these long years; I have fed frightfully upon his
      self-imposed banishment, upon his cheerless return home, upon his madness.
      But to-day&mdash;&rdquo; and hot tears gushed from his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;but to- day
      God has broken the hardness of my heart; and, dear Sir Weigand, look upon
      yourself no more as a murderer, and say that you will forgive me, and pray
      for him who has done you so fearful an injury, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobs choked his words. He fell at the feet of the pilgrim, who with tears
      of joy pressed him to his heart, in token of forgiveness.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 21
    </h3>
    <p>
      The joy of this hour passed from its first overpowering brightness to the
      calm, thoughtful aspect of daily life; and Weigand, now restored to
      health, laid aside the mantle with dead men&rsquo;s bones, saying: &ldquo;I had chosen
      for my penance to carry these fearful remains about with me, with the
      thought that some of them might have belonged to him whom I have murdered.
      Therefore I sought for them round about, in the deep beds of the
      mountain-torrents, and in the high nests of the eagles and vultures. And
      while I was searching, I sometimes&mdash;could it have been only an
      illusion?&mdash;seemed to meet a being who was very like myself, but far,
      far more powerful, and yet still paler and more haggard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An imploring look from Sintram stopped the flow of his words. With a
      gentle smile, Weigand bowed towards him, and said: &ldquo;You know now all the
      deep, unutterably deep, sorrow which preyed upon me. My fear of you, and
      my yearning love for you, are no longer an enigma to your kind heart. For,
      dear youth, though you may be like your fearful father, you have also the
      kind, gentle heart of your mother; and its reflection brightens your
      pallid, stern features, like the glow of a morning sky, which lights up
      ice-covered mountains and snowy valleys with the soft radiance of joy.
      But, alas! how long you have lived alone amidst your fellow-creatures! and
      how long since you have seen your mother, my dearly-loved Sintram!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel, too, as though a spring were gushing up in the barren
      wilderness,&rdquo; replied the youth; &ldquo;and I should perchance be altogether
      restored, could I but keep you long with me, and weep with you, dear lord.
      But I have that within me which says that you will very soon be taken from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, indeed,&rdquo; said the pilgrim, &ldquo;that my late song was very nearly
      my last, and that it contained a prediction full soon to be accomplished
      in me. But, as the soul of man is always like the thirsty ground, the more
      blessings God has bestowed on us, the more earnestly do we look out for
      new ones; so would I crave for one more before, as I hope, my blessed end.
      Yet, indeed, it cannot be granted me,&rdquo; added he, with a faltering voice;
      &ldquo;for I feel myself too utterly unworthy of so high a gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will be granted!&rdquo; said the chaplain, joyfully. &ldquo;&lsquo;He that humbleth
      himself shall be exalted;&rsquo; and I fear not to take one purified from murder
      to receive a farewell from the holy and forgiving countenance of Verena.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim stretched both his hands up towards heaven and an unspoken
      thanksgiving poured from his beaming eyes, and brightened the smile that
      played on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram looked sorrowfully on the ground, and sighed gently to himself:
      &ldquo;Alas! who would dare accompany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor, good Sintram,&rdquo; said the chaplain, in a tone of the softest
      kindness, &ldquo;I understand thee well; but the time is not yet come. The
      powers of evil will again raise up their wrathful heads within thee, and
      Verena must check both her own and thy longing desires, until all is pure
      in thy spirit as in hers. Comfort thyself with the thought that God looks
      mercifully upon thee, and that the joy so earnestly sought for will come&mdash;if
      not here, most assuredly beyond the grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the pilgrim, as though awaking out of a trance, rose mightily from his
      seat, and said: &ldquo;Do you please to come forth with me, reverend chaplain?
      Before the sun appears in the heavens, we could reach the convent-gates,
      and I should not be far from heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In vain did the chaplain and Rolf remind him of his weakness: he smiled,
      and said that there could be no words about it; and he girded himself, and
      tuned the lute which he had asked leave to take with him. His decided
      manner overcame all opposition, almost without words; and the chaplain had
      already prepared himself for the journey, when the pilgrim looked with
      much emotion at Sintram, who, oppressed with a strange weariness, had
      sunk, half-asleep, on a couch, and said: &ldquo;Wait a moment. I know that he
      wants me to give him a soft lullaby.&rdquo; The pleased smile of the youth
      seemed to say, Yes; and the pilgrim, touching the strings with a light
      hand, sang these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep peacefully, dear boy;<br /> Thy mother sends the song<br /> That
      whispers round thy couch,<br /> To lull thee all night long.<br /> In
      silence and afar<br /> For thee she ever prays,<br /> And longs once more in
      fondness<br /> Upon thy face to gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when thy waking cometh,<br /> Then in thy every deed,<br /> In all that
      may betide thee,<br /> Unto her words give heed.<br /> Oh, listen for her
      voice,<br /> If it be yea or nay;<br /> And though temptation meet thee,<br />
      Thou shalt not miss the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If thou canst listen rightly,<br /> And nobly onward go,<br /> Then pure and
      gentle breezes<br /> Around thy cheek shall blow.<br /> Then on thy peaceful
      journey<br /> Her blessing thou shalt feel,<br /> And though from thee
      divided,<br /> Her presence o&rsquo;er thee steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      O safest, sweetest comfort!<br /> O blest and living light!<br /> That,
      strong in Heaven&rsquo;s power,<br /> All terrors put to flight!<br /> Rest
      quietly, sweet child,<br /> And may the gentle numbers<br /> Thy mother
      sends to thee<br /> Waft peace unto thy slumbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram fell into a deep sleep, smiling, and breathing softly. Rolf and
      the castellan remained by his bed, whilst the two travellers pursued their
      way in the quiet starlight.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 22

      <img src="images/sintram14.jpg" alt="sintram14" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The dawn had almost appeared, when Rolf, who had been asleep, was awakened
      by low singing; and as he looked round, he perceived, with surprise, that
      the sounds came from the lips of the castellan, who said, as if in
      explanation, &ldquo;So does Sir Weigand sing at the convent- gates, and they are
      kindly opened to him.&rdquo; Upon which, old Rolf fell asleep again, uncertain
      whether what had passed had been a dream or a reality. After a while the
      bright sunshine awoke him again; and when he rose up, he saw the
      countenance of the castellan wonderfully illuminated by the red morning
      rays; and altogether those features, once so fearful, were shining with a
      soft, nay almost child-like mildness. The mysterious man seemed to be the
      while listening to the motionless air, as if he were hearing a most
      pleasant discourse or lofty music; and as Rolf was about to speak, he made
      him a sign of entreaty to remain quiet, and continued in his eager
      listening attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he sank slowly and contentedly back in his seat, whispering,
      &ldquo;God be praised! She has granted his last prayer; he will be laid in the
      burial-ground of the convent, and now he has forgiven me in the depths of
      his heart. I can assure you that he finds a peaceful end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rolf did not dare ask a question, or awake his lord; he felt as if one
      already departed had spoken to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castellan long remained still, always smiling brightly. At last he
      raised himself a little, again listened, and said, &ldquo;It is over. The sound
      of the bells is very sweet. We have overcome. Oh, how soft and easy does
      the good God make it to us!&rdquo; And so it came to pass. He stretched himself
      back as if weary, and his soul was freed from his care-worn body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rolf now gently awoke his young knight, and pointed to the smiling dead.
      And Sintram smiled too; he and his good esquire fell on their knees, and
      prayed to God for the departed spirit. Then they rose up, and bore the
      cold body to the vaulted hall, and watched by it with holy candles until
      the return of the chaplain. That the pilgrim would not come back again,
      they very well knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly towards mid-day the chaplain returned alone. He could scarcely
      do more than confirm what was already known to them. He only added a
      comforting and hopeful greeting from Sintram&rsquo;s mother to her son, and told
      that the blissful Weigand had fallen asleep like a tired child, whilst
      Verena, with calm tenderness, held a crucifix before him.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram16.jpg" alt="sintram16" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in eternal peace our penance end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      sang Sintram, gently to himself: and they prepared a last resting place
      for the now peaceful castellan, and laid him therein with all the due
      solemn rites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain was obliged soon afterwards to depart; but bidding Sintram
      farewell, he again said kindly to him, &ldquo;Thy dear mother assuredly knows
      how gentle and calm and good thou art now!&rdquo;

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 23
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the castle of Sir Biorn of the Fiery Eyes, Christmas-eve had not passed
      so brightly and happily; but yet, there too all had gone visibly according
      to God&rsquo;s will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folko, at the entreaty of the lord of the castle, had allowed Gabrielle to
      support him into the hall; and the three now sat at the round stone table,
      whereon a sumptuous meal was laid. On either side there were long tables,
      at which sat the retainers of both knights in full armour, according to
      the custom of the North. Torches and lamps lighted the lofty hall with an
      almost dazzling brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight had now begun its solemn reign, and Gabrielle softly reminded her
      wounded knight to withdraw. Biorn heard her, and said: &ldquo;You are right,
      fair lady; our knight needs rest. Only let us first keep up one more old
      honourable custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at his sign four attendants brought in with pomp a great boar&rsquo;s head,
      which looked as if cut out of solid gold, and placed it in the middle of
      the stone table. Biorn&rsquo;s retainers rose with reverence, and took off their
      helmets; Biorn himself did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means this?&rdquo; asked Folko very gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What thy forefathers and mine have done on every Yule feast,&rdquo; answered
      Biorn. &ldquo;We are going to make vows on the boar&rsquo;s head, and then pass the
      goblet round to their fulfilment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We no longer keep what our ancestors called the Yule feast,&rdquo; said Folko;
      &ldquo;we are good Christians, and we keep holy Christmas-tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do the one, and not to leave the other undone,&rdquo; answered Biorn. &ldquo;I
      hold my ancestors too dear to forget their knightly customs. Those who
      think otherwise may act according to their wisdom, but that shall not
      hinder me. I swear by the golden boar&rsquo;s head&mdash;&rdquo; And he stretched out
      his hand, to lay it solemnly upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Folko called out, &ldquo;In the name of our holy Saviour, forbear. Where I
      am, and still have breath and will, none shall celebrate undisturbed the
      rites of the wild heathens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn of the Fiery Eyes glared angrily at him. The men of the two barons
      separated from each other, with a hollow sound of rattling armour, and
      ranged themselves in two bodies on either side of the hall, each behind
      its leader. Already here and there helmets were fastened and visors
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink thee yet what thou art doing,&rdquo; said Biorn. &ldquo;I was about to vow an
      eternal union with the house of Montfaucon, nay, even to bind myself to do
      it grateful homage; but if thou disturb me in the customs which have come
      to me from my forefathers, look to thy safety and the safety of all that
      is dear to thee. My wrath no longer knows any bounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folko made a sign to the pale Gabrielle to retire behind his followers,
      saying to her, &ldquo;Be of good cheer, my noble wife, weaker Christians have
      braved, for the sake of God and of His holy Church, greater dangers than
      now seem to threaten us. Believe me, the Lord of Montfaucon is not so
      easily ensnared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle obeyed, something comforted by Folko&rsquo;s fearless smile, but this
      smile inflamed yet more the fury of Biorn. He again stretched out his hand
      towards the boar&rsquo;s head, as if about to make some dreadful vow, when Folko
      snatched a gauntlet of Biorn&rsquo;s off the table, with which he, with his
      unwounded left arm, struck so powerful a blow on the gilt idol, that it
      fell crashing to the ground, shivered to pieces. Biorn and his followers
      stood as if turned to stone. But soon swords were grasped by armed hands,
      shields were taken down from the walls, and an angry, threatening murmur
      sounded through the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Folko, a battle-axe was brought him by one of his faithful
      retainers; he swung it high in air with his powerful left hand, and stood
      looking like an avenging angel as he spoke these words through the tumult
      with awful calmness: &ldquo;What seek ye, O deluded Northman? What wouldst thou,
      sinful lord? Ye are indeed become heathens; and I hope to show you, by my
      readiness for battle, that it is not in my right arm alone that God has
      put strength for victory. But if ye can yet hear, listen to my words.
      Biorn, on this same accursed, and now, by God&rsquo;s help, shivered boar&rsquo;s
      head, thou didst lay thy hand when thou didst swear to sacrifice any
      inhabitants of the German towns that should fall into thy power. And
      Gotthard Lenz came, and Rudlieb came, driven on these shores by the storm.
      What didst thou then do, O savage Biorn? What did ye do at his bidding, ye
      who were keeping the Yule feast with him? Try your fortune on me. The Lord
      will be with me, as He was with those holy men. To arms, and&mdash;&rdquo; (he
      turned to his warriors) &ldquo;let our battle-cry be Gotthard and Rudlieb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Biorn let drop his drawn sword, then his followers paused, and none
      among the Norwegians dared lift his eyes from the ground. By degrees, they
      one by one began to disappear from the hall; and at last Biorn stood quite
      alone opposite to the baron and his followers. He seemed hardly aware that
      he had been deserted, but he fell on his knees, stretched out his shining
      sword, pointed to the broken boar&rsquo;s head, and said, &ldquo;Do with me as you
      have done with that; I deserve no better. I ask but one favour, only one;
      do not disgrace me, noble baron, by seeking shelter in another castle of
      Norway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear you not,&rdquo; answered Folko, after some thought; &ldquo;and, as far as may
      be, I freely forgive you.&rdquo; Then he drew the sign of the cross over the
      wild form of Biorn, and left the hall with Gabrielle. The retainers of the
      house of Montfaucon followed him proudly and silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard spirit of the fierce lord of the castle was now quite broken, and
      he watched with increased humility every look of Folko and Gabrielle. But
      they withdrew more and more into the happy solitude of their own
      apartments, where they enjoyed, in the midst of the sharp winter, a bright
      spring-tide of happiness. The wounded condition of Folko did not hinder
      the evening delights of songs and music and poetry&mdash;but rather a new
      charm was added to them when the tall, handsome knight leant on the arm of
      his delicate lady, and they thus, changing as it were their deportment and
      duties, walked slowly through the torch-lit halls, scattering their kindly
      greetings like flowers among the crowds of men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time little or nothing was heard of poor Sintram. The last wild
      outbreak of his father had increased the terror with which Gabrielle
      remembered the self-accusations of the youth; and the more resolutely
      Folko kept silence, the more did she bode some dreadful mystery. Indeed, a
      secret shudder came over the knight when he thought on the pale,
      dark-haired youth. Sintram&rsquo;s repentance had bordered on settled despair;
      no one knew even what he was doing in the fortress of evil report on the
      Rocks of the Moon. Strange rumours were brought by the retainers who had
      fled from it, that the evil spirit had obtained complete power over
      Sintram, that no man could stay with him, and that the fidelity of the
      dark mysterious castellan had cost him his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folko could hardly drive away the fearful suspicion that the lonely young
      knight was become a wicked magician.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps, indeed, evil spirits did flit about the banished Sintram, but
      it was without his calling them up. In his dreams he often saw the wicked
      enchantress Venus, in her golden chariot drawn by winged cats, pass over
      the battlements of the stone fortress, and heard her say, mocking him,
      &ldquo;Foolish Sintram, foolish Sintram! hadst thou but obeyed the little
      Master! Thou wouldst now be in Helen&rsquo;s arms, and the Rocks of the Moon
      would be called the Rocks of Love, and the stone fortress would be the
      garden of roses. Thou wouldst have lost thy pale face and dark hair,&mdash;for
      thou art only enchanted, dear youth,&mdash;and thine eyes would have
      beamed more softly, and thy cheeks bloomed more freshly, and thy hair
      would have been more golden than was that of Prince Paris when men
      wondered at his beauty. Oh, how Helen would have loved thee!&rdquo; Then she
      showed him in a mirror, how, as a marvellously beautiful knight, he knelt
      before Gabrielle, who sank into his arms blushing as the morning. When he
      awoke from such dreams, he would seize eagerly the sword and scarf given
      him by his lady,&mdash;as a shipwrecked man seizes the plank which is to
      save him; and while the hot tears fell on them, he would murmur to
      himself, &ldquo;There was, indeed, one hour in my sad life when I was worthy and
      happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once he sprang up at midnight after one of these dreams, but this time
      with more thrilling horror; for it had seemed to him that the features of
      the enchantress Venus had changed towards the end of her speech, as she
      looked down upon him with marvellous scorn, and she appeared to him as the
      hideous little Master. The youth had no better means of calming his
      distracted mind than to throw the sword and scarf of Gabrielle over his
      shoulders, and to hasten forth under the solemn starry canopy of the
      wintry sky. He walked in deep thought backwards and forwards under the
      leafless oaks and the snow- laden firs which grew on the high ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard a sorrowful cry of distress sound from the moat; it was as
      if some one were attempting to sing, but was stopped by inward grief.
      Sintram exclaimed, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; and all was still. When he was silent,
      and again began his walk, the frightful groanings and moanings were heard
      afresh, as if they came from a dying person. Sintram overcame the horror
      which seemed to hold him back, and began in silence to climb down into the
      deep dry moat which was cut in the rock. He was soon so low down that he
      could no longer see the stars shining; beneath him moved a shrouded form;
      and sliding with involuntary haste down the steep descent, he stood near
      the groaning figure; it ceased its lamentations, and began to laugh like a
      maniac from beneath its long, folded, female garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ho, my comrade! oh ho, my comrade! wert thou going a little too fast?
      Well, well, it is all right; and see now, thou standest no higher than I,
      my pious, valiant youth! Take it patiently,&mdash;take it patiently!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dost thou want with me? Why dost thou laugh? why dost thou weep?&rdquo;
       asked Sintram impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might ask thee the same questions,&rdquo; answered the dark figure, &ldquo;and thou
      wouldst be less able to answer me than I to answer thee. Why dost thou
      laugh? why dost thou weep?&mdash;Poor creature! But I will show thee a
      remarkable thing in thy fortress, of which thou knowest nothing. Give
      heed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the shrouded figure began to scratch and scrape at the stones till a
      little iron door opened, and showed a long passage which led into the deep
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou come with me?&rdquo; whispered the strange being; &ldquo;it is the shortest
      way to thy father&rsquo;s castle. In half-an-hour we shall come out of this
      passage, and we shall be in thy beauteous lady&rsquo;s apartment. Duke Menelaus
      shall lie in a magic sleep,&mdash;leave that to me,&mdash;and then thou
      wilt take the slight, delicate form in thine arms, and bring her to the
      Rocks of the Moon; so thou wilt win back all that seemed lost by thy
      former wavering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram trembled visibly, fearfully shaken to and fro by the fever of
      passion and the stings of conscience. But at last, pressing the sword and
      scarf to his heart, he cried out, &ldquo;Oh! that fairest, most glorious hour of
      my life! If I lose all other joys, I will hold fast that brightest hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bright, glorious hour!&rdquo; said the figure from under its veil, like an
      evil echo. &ldquo;Dost thou know whom thou then conqueredst? A good old friend,
      who only showed himself so sturdy to give thee the glory of overcoming
      him. Wilt thou convince thyself? Wilt thou look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark garments of the little figure flew open, and the dwarf warrior in
      strange armour, the gold horns on his helmet, and the curved spear in his
      hand, the very same whom Sintram thought he had slain on Niflung&rsquo;s Heath,
      now stood before him and laughed: &ldquo;Thou seest, my youth, everything in the
      wide world is but dreams and froth; wherefore hold fast the dream which
      delights thee, and sip up the froth which refreshes thee! Hasten to that
      underground passage, it leads up to thy angel Helen. Or wouldst thou first
      know thy friend yet better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visor opened, and the hateful face of the little Master glared upon
      the knight. Sintram asked, as if in a dream, &ldquo;Art thou also that wicked
      enchantress Venus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like her,&rdquo; answered the little Master, laughing, &ldquo;or rather she
      is something like me. And if thou wilt only get disenchanted, and recover
      the beauty of Prince of Paris,&mdash;then, O Prince Paris,&rdquo; and his voice
      changed to an alluring song, &ldquo;then, O Prince Paris, I shall be fair like
      thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the good Rolf appeared above on the rampart; a consecrated
      taper in his lantern shone down into the moat, as he sought for the
      missing young knight. &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, Sir Sintram,&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;what
      has the spectre of whom you slew on Niflung&rsquo;s Heath, and whom I never
      could bury, to do with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seest thou well? hearest thou well?&rdquo; whispered the little Master, and
      drew back into the darkness of the underground passage. &ldquo;The wise man up
      there knows me well. There was nothing in thy heroic feat. Come, take the
      joys of life while thou mayst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sintram sprang back, with a strong effort, into the circle of light
      made by the shining of the taper from above, and cried out, &ldquo;Depart from
      me, unquiet spirit! I know well that I bear a name on me in which thou
      canst have no part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Master rushed in fear and rage into the passage, and, yelling, shut
      the iron door behind him. It seemed as if he could still be heard groaning
      and roaring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram climbed up the wall of the moat, and made a sign to his
      foster-father not to speak to him: he only said, &ldquo;One of my best joys,
      yes, the very best, has been taken from me; but, by God&rsquo;s help, I am not
      yet lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the earliest light of the following morning, he and Rolf stopped up the
      entrance to the perilous passage with huge blocks of stone.

    <p>
      The long northern winter was at last ended, the fresh green leaves rustled
      merrily in the woods, patches of soft moss twinkled amongst the rocks, the
      valleys grew green, the brooks sparkled, the snow melted from all but the
      highest mountain-tops, and the bark which was ready to carry away Folko
      and Gabrielle danced on the sunny waves of the sea. The baron, now quite
      recovered, and strong and fresh as though his health had sustained no
      injury, stood one morning on the shore with his fair lady; and, full of
      glee at the prospect of returning to their home, the noble pair looked on
      well pleased at their attendants who were busied in lading the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said one of them in the midst of a confused sound of talking: &ldquo;But
      what has appeared to me the most fearful and the most strange thing in
      this northern land is the stone fortress on the Rocks of the Moon: I have
      never, indeed, been inside it, but when I used to see it in our huntings,
      towering above the tall fir-trees, there came a tightness over my breast,
      as if something unearthly were dwelling in it. And a few weeks ago, when
      the snow was yet lying hard in the valleys, I came unawares quite close
      upon the strange building. The young knight Sintram was walking alone on
      the ramparts as twilight came on, like the spirit of a departed knight,
      and he drew from the lute which he carried such soft, melancholy tones,
      and he sighed so deeply and sorrowfully. . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the speaker was drowned in the noise of the crowd, and as he
      also just then reached the ship with his package hastily fastened up,
      Folko and Gabrielle could not hear the rest of his speech. But the fair
      lady looked on her knight with eyes dim with tears, and sighed: &ldquo;Is it not
      behind those mountains that the Rocks of the Moon lie? The unhappy Sintram
      makes me sad at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand thee, sweet gracious lady, and the pure compassion of thy
      heart,&rdquo; replied Folko; instantly ordering his swift-footed steed to be
      brought. He placed his noble lady under the charge of his retainers, and
      leaping into the saddle, he hastened, followed by the grateful smiles of
      Gabrielle, along the valley towards the stone fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram was seated near the drawbridge, touching the strings of the lute,
      and shedding some tears on the golden chords, almost as Montfaucon&rsquo;s
      esquire had described him. Suddenly a cloudy shadow passed over him, and
      he looked up, expecting to see a flight of cranes in the air; but the sky
      was clear and blue. While the young knight was still wondering, a long
      bright spear fell at his feet from a battlement of the armoury turret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it up,&mdash;make good use of it! thy foe is near at hand! Near also
      is the downfall of thy dearest happiness.&rdquo; Thus he heard it distinctly
      whispered in his ear; and it seemed to him that he saw the shadow of the
      little Master glide close by him to a neighbouring cleft in the rock. But
      at the same time also, a tall, gigantic, haggard figure passed along the
      valley, in some measure like the departed pilgrim, only much, very much,
      larger, and he raised his long bony arm fearfully threatening, then
      disappeared in an ancient tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very same instant Sir Folko of Montfaucon came swiftly as the wind
      up the Rocks of the Moon, and he must have seen something of those strange
      apparitions, for as he stopped close behind Sintram, he looked rather
      pale, and asked low and earnestly: &ldquo;Sir knight, who are those two with
      whom you were just now holding converse here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good God knows,&rdquo; answered Sintram; &ldquo;I know them not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the good God does but know!&rdquo; cried Montfaucon: &ldquo;but I fear me that He
      knows very little more of you or your deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak strangely harsh words,&rdquo; said Sintram. &ldquo;Yet ever since that
      evening of misery,&mdash;alas! and even long before,&mdash;I must bear
      with all that comes from you. Dear sir, you may believe me, I know not
      those fearful companions; I call them not, and I know not what terrible
      curse binds them to my footsteps. The merciful God, as I would hope, is
      mindful of me the while,&mdash;as a faithful shepherd does not forget even
      the worst and most widely-straying of his flock, but calls after it with
      an anxious voice in the gloomy wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the anger of the baron was quite melted. Two bright tears stood in
      his eyes, and he said: &ldquo;No, assuredly, God has not forgotten thee; only do
      thou not forget thy gracious God. I did not come to rebuke thee&mdash;I
      came to bless thee in Gabrielle&rsquo;s name and in my own. The Lord preserve
      thee, the Lord guide thee, the Lord lift thee up! And, Sintram, on the
      far-off shores of Normandy I shall bear thee in mind, and I shall hear how
      thou strugglest against the curse which weighs down thy unhappy life; and
      if thou ever shake it off, and stand as a noble conqueror over Sin and
      Death, then thou shalt receive from me a token of love and reward, more
      precious then either thou or I can understand at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words flowed prophetically from the baron&rsquo;s lips; he himself was only
      half-conscious of what he said. With a kind salutation he turned his noble
      steed, and again flew down the valley towards the sea-shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool, fool! thrice a fool!&rdquo; whispered the angry voice of the little
      Master in Sintram&rsquo;s ear. But old Rolf was singing his morning hymn in
      clear tones within the castle, and the last lines were these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom worldlings scorn,<br /> Who lives forlorn,<br /> On God&rsquo;s own word
      doth rest;<br /> With heavenly light<br /> His path is bright,<br /> His lot
      among the blest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a holy joy took possession of Sintram&rsquo;s heart, and he looked around
      him yet more gladly than in the hour when Gabrielle gave him the scarf and
      sword, and Folko dubbed him knight.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAPTER 25
    </h3>
    <p>
      The baron and his lovely lady were sailing across the broad sea with
      favouring gales of spring, nay the coast of Normandy had already appeared
      above the waves; but still was Biorn of the Fiery Eye sitting gloomy and
      speechless in his castle. He had taken no leave of his guests. There was
      more of proud fear of Montfaucon than of reverential love for him in his
      soul, especially since the adventure with the boar&rsquo;s head; and the thought
      was bitter to his haughty spirit, that the great baron, the flower and
      glory of their whole race, should have come in peace to visit him, and
      should now be departing in displeasure, in stern reproachful displeasure.
      He had it constantly before his mind, and it never failed to bring fresh
      pangs, the remembrance of how all had come to pass, and how all might have
      gone otherwise; and he was always fancying he could hear the songs in
      which after generations would recount this voyage of the great Folko, and
      the worthlessness of the savage Biorn. At length, full of fierce anger, he
      cast away the fetters of his troubled spirit, he burst out of the castle
      with all his horsemen, and began to carry on a warfare more fearful and
      more lawless than any in which he had yet been engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram heard the sound of his father&rsquo;s war-horn; and committing the stone
      fortress to old Rolf, he sprang forth ready armed for the combat. But the
      flames of the cottages and farms on the mountains rose up before him, and
      showed him, written as if in characters of fire, what kind of war his
      father was waging. Yet he went on towards the spot where the army was
      mustered, but only to offer his mediation, affirming that he would not lay
      his hand on his good sword in so abhorred a service, even though the stone
      fortress, and his father&rsquo;s castle besides, should fall before the
      vengeance of their enemies. Biorn hurled the spear which he held in his
      hand against his son with mad fury. The deadly weapon whizzed past him:
      Sintram remained standing with his visor raised, he did not move one limb
      in his defence, when he said: &ldquo;Father, do what you will; but I join not in
      your godless warfare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn of the Fiery Eyes laughed scornfully: &ldquo;It seems I am always to have
      a spy over me here; my son succeeds to the dainty French knight!&rdquo; But
      nevertheless he came to himself, accepted Sintram&rsquo;s mediation, made amends
      for the injuries he had done, and returned gloomily to his castle. Sintram
      went back to the Rocks of the Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such occurrences were frequent after that time. It went so far that
      Sintram came to be looked upon as the protector of all those whom his
      father pursued with relentless fury; but nevertheless sometimes his own
      wildness would carry the young knight away to accompany his fierce father
      in his fearful deeds. Then Biorn used to laugh with horrible pleasure, and
      to say: &ldquo;See there, my son, how the flames we have lighted blaze up from
      the villages, as the blood spouts up from the wounds our swords have made!
      It is plain to me, however much thou mayst pretend to the contrary, that
      thou art, and wilt ever remain, my true and beloved heir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After thus fearfully erring, Sintram could find no comfort but in
      hastening to the chaplain of Drontheim, and confessing to him his misery
      and his sins. The chaplain would freely absolve him, after due penance and
      repentance, and again raise up the broken-hearted youth; but would often
      say: &ldquo;Oh, how nearly hadst thou reached thy last trial, and gained the
      victory, and looked on Verena&rsquo;s countenance, and atoned for all! Now thou
      hast thrown thyself back for years. Think, my son, on the shortness of
      man&rsquo;s life; if thou art always falling back anew, how wilt thou ever gain
      the summit on this side the grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      *** *** ***
    </p>
    <p>
      Years came and went, and Biorn&rsquo;s hair was white as snow, and the youth
      Sintram had reached the middle age. Old Rolf was now scarcely able to
      leave the stone fortress; and sometimes he said: &ldquo;I feel it a burden that
      my life should yet be prolonged; but also there is much comfort in it, for
      I still think the good God has in store for me here below some great
      happiness; and it must be something in which you are concerned, my beloved
      Sir Sintram, for what else in the whole world could rejoice me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all remained as it was, and Sintram&rsquo;s fearful dreams at Christmas-time
      each year rather increased than diminished in horror. Again the holy
      season was drawing near, and the mind of the sorely afflicted knight was
      more troubled than ever before. Sometimes, if he had been reckoning up the
      nights till it should come, a cold sweat would stand on his forehead,
      while he said, &ldquo;Mark my words, dear old foster-father, this time something
      most awfully decisive lies before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening he felt an overwhelming anxiety about his father. It seemed to
      him that the Prince of Darkness was going up to Biorn&rsquo;s castle; and in
      vain did Rolf remind him that the snow was lying deep in the valleys, in
      vain did he suggest that the knight might be overtaken by his frightful
      dreams in the lonely mountains during the night-time. &ldquo;Nothing can be
      worse to me than remaining here would be,&rdquo; replied Sintram.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his horse from the stable and rode forth in the gathering
      darkness. The noble steed slipped and stumbled and fell in the trackless
      way, but his rider always raised him up, and urged him only more swiftly
      and eagerly towards the object which he longed and yet dreaded to reach.
      Nevertheless he might never have arrived at it had not his faithful hound
      Skovmark kept with him. The dog sought out the lost track for his beloved
      master, and invited him into it with joyous barkings, and warned him by
      his howls against precipices and treacherous ice under the snow. Thus they
      arrived about midnight at Biorn&rsquo;s castle. The windows of the hall shone
      opposite to them with a brilliant light, as though some great feast were
      kept there, and confused sounds, as of singing, met their ears. Sintram
      gave his horse hastily to some retainers in the court-yard, and ran up the
      steps, whilst Skovmark stayed by the well-known horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good esquire came towards Sintram within the castle and said, &ldquo;God be
      praised, my dear master, that you are come; for surely nothing good is
      going on above. But take heed to yourself also, and be not deluded. Your
      father has a guest with him,&mdash;and, as I think&mdash;a hateful one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram shuddered as he threw open the doors. A little man in the dress of
      a miner was sitting with his back towards him. The armour had been for
      some time past again ranged round the stone table, so that only two places
      were left empty. The seat opposite the door had been taken by Biorn of the
      Fiery Eyes; and the dazzling light of the torches fell upon his features
      with so red a flare, that he perfectly enacted that fearful surname.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, whom have you here with you?&rdquo; cried Sintram; and his suspicions
      rose to certainty as the miner turned round, and the detestable face of
      the little Master grinned from under his dark hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just see, my fair son,&rdquo; said the wild Biorn; &ldquo;thou hast not been
      here for a long while,&mdash;and so to-night this jolly comrade has paid
      me a visit, and thy place has been taken. But throw one of the suits of
      armour out of the way, and put a seat for thyself instead of it,&mdash;and
      come and drink with us, and be merry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do so, Sir Sintram,&rdquo; said the little Master, with a laugh. &ldquo;Nothing
      worse could come of it than that the broken pieces of armour might clatter
      somewhat strangely together, or at most that the disturbed spirit of him
      to whom the suit belonged might look over your shoulder; but he would not
      drink up any of our wine&mdash;ghosts have nothing to do with that. So now
      fall to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn joined in the laughter of the hideous stranger with wild mirth; and
      while Sintram was mustering up his whole strength not to lose his senses
      at so terrible words, and was fixing a calm, steady look on the little
      Master&rsquo;s face, the old man cried out, &ldquo;Why dost thou look at him so? Does
      it seem as though thou sawest thyself in a mirror? Now that you are
      together, I do not see it so much; but a while ago I thought that you were
      like enough to each other to be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said Sintram, walking up close to the fearful apparition: &ldquo;I
      command thee, detestable stranger, to depart from this castle, in right of
      my authority as my father&rsquo;s heir,&mdash;as a consecrated knight and as a
      spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Biorn seemed as if he wished to oppose himself to this command with all
      his savage might. The little Master muttered to himself, &ldquo;Thou art not by
      any means the master in this house, pious knight; thou hast never lighted
      a fire on this hearth.&rdquo; Then Sintram drew the sword which Gabrielle had
      given him, held the cross of the hilt before the eyes of his evil guest,
      and said, calmly, but with a powerful voice, &ldquo;Worship or fly!&rdquo; And he
      fled, the frightful stranger,&mdash;he fled with such lightning speed,
      that it could scarcely be seen whether he had sprung through the window or
      the door. But in going he overthrew some of the armour, the tapers went
      out, and it seemed that the pale blue flame which lighted up the whole in
      a marvellous manner gave a fulfilment to the little Master&rsquo;s former words:
      and that the spirits of those to whom the armour had belonged were leaning
      over the table, grinning fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the father and the son were filled with horror; but each chose an
      opposite way to save himself. Biorn wished to have his hateful guest back
      again; and the power of his will was seen when the little Master&rsquo;s step
      resounded anew on the stairs, and his brown shrivelled hand shook the lock
      of the door. On the other hand, Sintram ceased not to say within himself,
      &ldquo;We are lost, if he come back! We are lost to all eternity, if he come
      back!&rdquo; And he fell on his knees, and prayed fervently from his troubled
      heart to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Then the little Master left the
      door, and again Biorn willed him to return, and again Sintram&rsquo;s prayers
      drove him away. So went on this strife of wills throughout the long night;
      and howling whirlwinds raged the while around the castle, till all the
      household thought the end of the world was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the dawn of morning appeared through the windows of the hall,&mdash;the
      fury of the storm was lulled,&mdash;Biorn sank back powerless in slumber
      on his seat,&mdash;peace and hope came to the inmates of the castle,&mdash;and
      Sintram, pale and exhausted, went out to breathe the dewy air of the mild
      winter&rsquo;s morning before the castle-gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkChapter26" id="linkChapter26"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAPTER 26
    </h3>
    <p>
      The faithful Skovmark followed his master, caressing him; and when Sintram
      fell asleep on a stone seat in the wall, he lay at his feet, keeping
      watchful guard. Suddenly he pricked up his ears, looked round with
      delight, and bounded joyfully down the mountain. Just afterwards the
      chaplain of Drontheim appeared amongst the rocks, and the good beast went
      up to him as if to greet him, and then again ran back to the knight to
      announce the welcome visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram opened his eyes, as a child whose Christmas gifts have been placed
      at his bedside. For the chaplain smiled at him as he had never yet seen
      him smile. There was in it a token of victory and blessing, or at least of
      the near approach of both. &ldquo;Thou hast done much yesterday, very much,&rdquo;
       said the holy priest; and his hands were joined, and his eyes full of
      bright tears. &ldquo;I praise God for thee, my noble knight. Verena knows all,
      and she too praises God for thee. I do indeed now dare hope that the time
      will soon come when thou mayst appear before her. But Sintram, Sir
      Sintram, there is need of haste; for the old man above requires speedy
      air, and thou hast still a heavy&mdash;as I hope the last&mdash;yet a most
      heavy trial to undergo for his sake. Arm thyself, my knight, arm thyself
      even with bodily weapons. In truth, this time only spiritual armour is
      needed, but it always befits a knight, as well as a monk, to wear in
      decisive moments the entire solemn garb of his station. If it so please
      thee, we will go directly to Drontheim together. Thou must return thence
      to-night. Such is a part of the hidden decree, which has been dimly
      unfolded to Verena&rsquo;s foresight. Here there is yet much that is wild and
      distracting, and thou hast great need to-day of calm preparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With humble joy Sintram bowed his assent, and called for his horse and for
      a suit of armour. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;let not any of that armour be brought
      which was last night overthrown in the hall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His orders were quickly obeyed. The arms which were fetched, adorned with
      fine engraved work, the simple helmet, formed rather like that of an
      esquire than a knight, the lance of almost gigantic size, which belonged
      to the suit&mdash;on all these the chaplain gazed in deep thought and with
      melancholy emotion. At last, when Sintram, with the help of his esquires,
      was well-nigh equipped, the holy priest spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful providence of God! See, dear Sintram, this armour and this
      spear were formerly those of Sir Weigand the Slender, and with them he did
      many mighty deeds. When he was tended by your mother in the castle, and
      when even your father still showed himself kind towards him, he asked, as
      a favour, that his armour and his lance should be allowed to hang in
      Biorn&rsquo;s armoury&mdash;Weigand himself, as you well know, intended to build
      a cloister and to live there as a monk&mdash; and he put his old esquire&rsquo;s
      helmet with it, instead of another, because he was yet wearing that one
      when he first saw the fair Verena&rsquo;s angelic face. How wondrously does it
      now come to pass, that these very arms, which have so long been laid
      aside, should be brought to you for the decisive hour of your life! To me,
      as far as my short-sighted human wisdom can tell,&mdash;to me it seems
      truly a very solemn token, but one full of high and glorious promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram stood now in complete array, composed and stately, and, from his
      tall slender figure, might have been taken for a youth, had not the deep
      lines of care which furrowed his countenance shown him to be advanced in
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has placed boughs on the head of my war-horse?&rdquo; asked Sintram of the
      esquires, with displeasure. &ldquo;I am not a conqueror, nor a wedding-guest.
      And besides, there are no boughs now but those red and yellow crackling
      oak-leaves, dull and dead like the season itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight, I know not myself,&rdquo; answered an esquire; &ldquo;but it seemed to me
      that it must be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be,&rdquo; said the chaplain. &ldquo;I feel that this also comes as a token
      full of meaning from the right source.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the knight threw himself into his saddle; the priest went beside him;
      and they both rode slowly and silently towards Drontheim. The faithful dog
      followed his master. When the lofty castle of Drontheim appeared in sight,
      a gentle smile spread itself over Sintram&rsquo;s countenance, like sunshine
      over a wintry valley. &ldquo;God has done great things for me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I once
      rushed from here, a fearfully wild boy; I now come back a penitent man. I
      trust that it will yet go well with my poor troubled life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chaplain assented kindly, and soon afterwards the travellers passed
      under the echoing vaulted gateway into the castle-yard. At a sign from the
      priest, the retainers approached with respectful haste, and took charge of
      the horse; then he and Sintram went through long winding passages and up
      many steps to the remote chamber which the chaplain had chosen for
      himself; far away from the noise of men, and near to the clouds and the
      stars. There the two passed a quiet day in devout prayer, and earnest
      reading of Holy Scripture.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the evening began to close in, the chaplain arose and said: &ldquo;And now,
      my knight, get ready thy horse, and mount and ride back again to thy
      father&rsquo;s castle. A toilsome way lies before thee, and I dare not go with
      you. But I can and will call upon the Lord for you all through the long
      fearful night. O beloved instrument of the Most High, thou wilt yet not be
      lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thrilling with strange forebodings, but nevertheless strong and vigorous
      in spirit, Sintram did according to the holy man&rsquo;s desire. The sun set as
      the knight approached a long valley, strangely shut in by rocks, through
      which lay the road to his father&rsquo;s castle.
    </p>

      CHAPTER 27

    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram18.jpg" alt="sintram18" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      Before entering the rocky pass, the knight, with a prayer and
      thanksgiving, looked back once more at the castle of Drontheim. There it
      was, so vast and quiet and peaceful; the bright windows of the chaplain&rsquo;s
      high chamber yet lighted up by the last gleam of the sun, which had
      already disappeared. In front of Sintram was the gloomy valley, as if his
      grave. Then there came towards him some one riding on a small horse; and
      Skovmark, who had gone up to the stranger as if to find out who he was,
      now ran back with his tail between his legs and his ears put back, howling
      and whining, and crept, terrified, under his master&rsquo;s war-horse. But even
      the noble steed appeared to have forgotten his once so fearless and
      warlike ardour. He trembled violently, and when the knight would have
      turned him towards the stranger, he reared and snorted and plunged, and
      began to throw himself backwards. It was only with difficulty that
      Sintram&rsquo;s strength and horsemanship got the better of him; and he was all
      white with foam when Sintram came up to the unknown traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have cowardly beasts with you,&rdquo; said the latter, in a low, smothered
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram was unable, in the ever-increasing darkness, rightly to
      distinguish what kind of being he saw before him; only a very pallid face,
      which at first he had thought was covered with freshly fallen snow, met
      his eyes from amidst the long hanging garments. It seemed that the
      stranger carried a small box wrapped up; his little horse, as if wearied
      out, bent his head down towards the ground, whereby a bell, which hung
      from the wretched torn bridle under his neck, was made to give a strange
      sound. After a short silence, Sintram replied: &ldquo;Noble steeds avoid those
      of a worse race, because they are ashamed of them; and the boldest dogs
      are attacked by a secret terror at sight of forms to which they are not
      accustomed. I have no cowardly beasts with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, sir knight; then ride with me through the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going through the valley, but I want no companions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps I want one. Do you not see that I am unarmed? And at this
      season, at this hour, there are frightful, unearthly beasts about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then, as though to confirm the awful words of the stranger, a thing
      swung itself down from one of the nearest trees, covered with hoar-frost,&mdash;no
      one could say if it were a snake or a lizard,&mdash;it curled and twisted
      itself, and appeared about to slide down upon the knight or his companion.
      Sintram levelled his spear, and pierced the creature through. But, with
      the most hideous contortions, it fixed itself firmly on the spear-head;
      and in vain did the knight endeavour to rub it off against the rocks or
      the trees. Then he let his spear rest upon his right shoulder, with the
      point behind him, so that the horrible beast no longer met his sight; and
      he said, with good courage, to the stranger, &ldquo;It does seem, indeed, that I
      could help you, and I am not forbidden to have an unknown stranger in my
      company; so let us push on bravely into the valley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; so resounded the solemn answer; &ldquo;not help. I perhaps may help
      thee. But God have mercy upon thee if the time should ever come when I
      could no longer help thee. Then thou wouldst be lost, and I should become
      very frightful to thee. But we will go through the valley&mdash;I have thy
      knightly word for it. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rode forward; Sintram&rsquo;s horse still showing signs of fear, the
      faithful dog still whining; but both obedient to their master&rsquo;s will. The
      knight was calm and steadfast. The snow had slipped down from the smooth
      rocks, and by the light of the rising moon could be seen various strange
      twisted shapes on their sides, some looking like snakes, and some like
      human faces; but they were only formed by the veins in the rock and the
      half-bare roots of trees, which had planted themselves in that desert
      place with capricious firmness. High above, and at a great distance, the
      castle of Drontheim, as if to take leave, appeared again through an
      opening in the rocks. The knight then looked keenly at his companion, and
      he almost felt as if Weigand the Slender were riding beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;art thou not the shade of that departed knight
      who suffered and died for Verena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not suffered, I have not died; but ye suffer, and ye die, poor
      mortals!&rdquo; murmured the stranger. &ldquo;I am not Weigand. I am that other, who
      was so like him, and whom thou hast also met before now in the wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram strove to free himself from the terror which came over him at
      these words. He looked at his horse; it appeared to him entirely altered.
      The dry, many-coloured oak-leaves on its head were waving like the flames
      around a sacrifice, in the uncertain moonlight. He looked down again, to
      see after his faithful Skovmark. Fear had likewise most wondrously changed
      him. On the ground in the middle of the road were lying dead men&rsquo;s bones,
      and hideous lizards were crawling about; and, in defiance of the wintry
      season, poisonous mushrooms were growing up all around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this be still my horse on which I am riding?&rdquo; said the knight to
      himself, in a low voice; &ldquo;and can that trembling beast which runs at my
      side be my dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then some one called after him, in a yelling voice, &ldquo;Stop! stop! Take me
      also with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking round, Sintram perceived a small, frightful figure with horns, and
      a face partly like a wild boar and partly like a bear, walking along on
      its hind-legs, which were those of a horse; and in its hand was a strange,
      hideous weapon, shaped like a hook or a sickle. It was the being who had
      been wont to trouble him in his dreams; and, alas! it was also the
      wretched little Master himself, who, laughing wildly, stretched out a long
      claw towards the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bewildered Sintram murmured, &ldquo;I must have fallen asleep; and now my
      dreams are coming over me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art awake,&rdquo; replied the rider of the little horse, &ldquo;but thou knowest
      me also in thy dreams. For, behold! I am Death.&rdquo; And his garments fell
      from him, and there appeared a mouldering skeleton, its ghastly head
      crowned with serpents; that which he had kept hidden under his mantle was
      an hour-glass with the sand almost run out. Death held it towards the
      knight in his fleshless hand. The bell at the neck of the little horse
      gave forth a solemn sound. It was a passing bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit!&rdquo; prayed Sintram; and full of
      earnest devotion he rode after Death, who beckoned him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has thee not yet! He has thee not yet!&rdquo; screamed the fearful fiend.
      &ldquo;Give thyself up to me rather. In one instant,&mdash;for swift are thy
      thoughts, swift is my might,&mdash;in one instant thou shalt be in
      Normandy. Helen yet blooms in beauty as when she departed hence, and this
      very night she would be thine.&rdquo; And once again he began his unholy praises
      of Gabrielle&rsquo;s loveliness, and Sintram&rsquo;s heart glowed like wild-fire in
      his weak breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death said nothing more, but raised the hour-glass in his right hand yet
      higher and higher; and as the sand now ran out more quickly, a soft light
      streamed from the glass over Sintram&rsquo;s countenance, and then it seemed to
      him as if eternity in all its calm majesty were rising before him, and a
      world of confusion dragging him back with a deadly grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I command thee, wild form that followest me,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I command thee,
      in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to cease from thy seducing words,
      and to call thyself by that name by which thou art recorded in Holy Writ!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A name, more fearful than a thunderclap, burst despairingly from the lips
      of the Tempter, and he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will return no more,&rdquo; said Death, in a kindly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I am become wholly thine, my stern companion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, my Sintram. I shall not come to thee till many, many years are
      past. But thou must not forget me the while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep the thought of thee steadily before my soul, thou fearful yet
      wholesome monitor, thou awful yet loving guide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can truly appear very gentle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it proved indeed. His form became more softly defined in the
      increasing gleam of light which shone from the hour-glass; the features,
      which had been awful in their sternness, wore a gentle smile; the crown of
      serpents became a bright palm-wreath; instead of the horse appeared a
      white misty cloud in the moonlight; and the bell gave forth sounds as of
      sweet lullabies. Sintram thought he could hear these words amidst them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world and Satan are o&rsquo;ercome,<br /> Before thee gleams eternal light,<br />
      Warrior, who hast won the strife:<br /> Save from darkest shades of night<br />
      Him before whose aged eyes<br /> All my terrors soon shall rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knight well knew that his father was meant; and he urged on his noble
      steed, which now obeyed his master willingly and gladly, and the faithful
      dog also again ran beside him fearlessly. Death had disappeared; but in
      front of Sintram there floated a bright morning cloud, which continued
      visible after the sun had risen clear and warm in the bright winter sky.

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead! the horrors of that fearful stormy night have killed him!&rdquo;
       Thus said, about this time, some of Biorn&rsquo;s retainers, who had not been
      able to bring him back to his senses since the morning of the day before:
      they had made a couch of wolf and bear skins for him in the great hall, in
      the midst of the armour which still lay scattered around. One of the
      esquires said with a low sigh: &ldquo;The Lord have mercy on his poor wild
      soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the warder blew his horn from his tower, and a trooper came into
      the room with a look of surprise. &ldquo;A knight is coming hither,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;a
      wonderful knight. I could have taken him for our Lord Sintram&mdash;but a
      bright, bright morning cloud floats so close before him, and throws over
      him such a clear light, that one could fancy red flowers were showered
      down upon him. Besides, his horse has a wreath of red leaves on his head,
      which was never a custom of the son of our dead lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just such a one,&rdquo; replied another, &ldquo;I wove for him yesterday. He was not
      pleased with it at first, but afterwards he let it remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didst thou that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to me as if I heard a voice singing again and again in my ear:
      &lsquo;Victory! victory! the noblest victory! The knight rides forth to
      victory!&rsquo; And then I saw a branch of our oldest oak-tree stretched towards
      me, which had kept on almost all its red and yellow leaves in spite of the
      snow. So I did according to what I had heard sung; and I plucked some of
      the leaves, and wove a triumphal wreath for the noble war-horse. At the
      same time Skovmark,&mdash;you know that the faithful beast had always a
      great dislike to Biorn, and therefore had gone to the stable with the
      horse,&mdash;Skovmark jumped upon me, fawning, and seemed pleased, as if
      he wanted to thank me for my work; and such noble animals understand well
      about good prognostics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard the sound of Sintram&rsquo;s spurs on the stone steps, and Skovmark&rsquo;s
      joyous bark. At that instant the supposed corpse of old Biorn sat up,
      looked around with rolling, staring eyes, and asked of the terrified
      retainers in a hollow voice, &ldquo;Who comes there, ye people? who comes there?
      I know it is my son. But who comes with him? The answer to that bears the
      sword of decision in its mouth. For see, good people, Gotthard and Rudlieb
      have prayed much for me; yet if the little Master come with him, I am lost
      in spite of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art not lost, my beloved father!&rdquo; Sintram&rsquo;s kind voice was heard to
      say, as he softly opened the door, and the bright red morning cloud
      floated in with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biorn joined his hands, cast a look of thankfulness up to heaven, and
      said, smiling, &ldquo;Yes, praised be God! it is the right companion! It is
      sweet gentle death!&rdquo; And then he made a sign to his son to approach,
      saying, &ldquo;Come here, my deliverer; come, blessed of the Lord, that I may
      relate to thee all that has passed within me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Sintram now sat close by his father&rsquo;s couch, all who were in the room
      perceived a remarkable and striking change. For old Biorn, whose whole
      countenance, and not his eyes alone, had been wont to have a fiery aspect,
      was now quite pale, almost like white marble; while, on the other hand,
      the cheeks of the once deadly pale Sintram glowed with a bright bloom like
      that of early youth. It was caused by the morning cloud which still shone
      upon him, whose presence in the room was rather felt than seen; but it
      produced a gentle thrill in every heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, my son,&rdquo; began the old man, softly and mildly, &ldquo;I have lain for a
      long time in a death-like sleep, and have known nothing of what was going
      on around me; but within,&mdash;ah! within, I have known but too much! I
      thought that my soul would be destroyed by the eternal anguish; and yet
      again I felt, with much greater horror, that my soul was eternal like that
      anguish. Beloved son, thy cheeks that glowed so brightly are beginning to
      grow pale at my words. I refrain from more. But let me relate to you
      something more cheering. Far, far away, I could see a bright lofty church,
      where Gotthard and Rudlieb Lenz were kneeling and praying for me. Gotthard
      had grown very old, and looked almost like one of our mountains covered
      with snow, on which the sun, in the lovely evening hours, is shining; and
      Rudlieb was also an elderly man, but very vigorous and very strong; and
      they both, with all their strength and vigour, were calling upon God to
      aid me, their enemy. Then I heard a voice like that of an angel, saying,
      &lsquo;His son does the most for him! He must this night wrestle with death and
      with the fallen one! His victory will be victory, and his defeat will be
      defeat, for the old man and himself.&rsquo; Thereupon I awoke; and I knew that
      all depended upon whom thou wouldst bring with thee. Thou hast conquered.
      Next to God, the praise be to thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gotthard and Rudlieb have helped much,&rdquo; replied Sintram; &ldquo;and, beloved
      father, so have the fervent prayers of the chaplain of Drontheim. I felt,
      when struggling with temptation and deadly fear, how the heavenly breath
      of holy men floated round me and aided me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most willing to believe that, my noble son, and everything thou
      sayest to me,&rdquo; answered the old man; and at the same moment the chaplain
      also coming in, Biorn stretched out his hand towards him with a smile of
      peace and joy. And now all seemed to be surrounded with a bright circle of
      unity and blessedness. &ldquo;But see,&rdquo; said old Biorn, &ldquo;how the faithful
      Skovmark jumps upon me now, and tries to caress me. It is not long since
      he used always to howl with terror when he saw me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lord,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;there is a spirit dwelling in good
      beasts, though dreamy and unconscious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the day wore on, the stillness in the hall increased. The last hour of
      the aged knight was drawing near, but he met it calmly and fearlessly. The
      chaplain and Sintram prayed beside his couch. The retainers knelt devoutly
      around. At length the dying man said: &ldquo;Is that the prayer-bell in Verena&rsquo;s
      cloister?&rdquo; Sintram&rsquo;s looks said yea; while warm tears fell on the
      colourless cheeks of his father. A gleam shone in the old man&rsquo;s eyes, the
      morning cloud stood close over him, and then the gleam, the morning cloud,
      and life with them, departed from him.

    <h3>
      CHAPTER 29
    </h3>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram20.jpg" alt="sintram20" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards Sintram stood in the parlour of the convent, and
      waited with a beating heart for his mother to appear. He had seen her for
      the last time when, a slumbering child, he had been awakened by her warm
      farewell kisses, and then had fallen asleep again, to wonder in his dreams
      what his mother had wanted with him, and to seek her in vain the next
      morning in the castle and in the garden. The chaplain was now at his side,
      rejoicing in the chastened rapture of the knight, whose fierce spirit had
      been softened, on whose cheeks a light reflection of that solemn morning
      cloud yet lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inner doors opened. In her white veil, stately and noble, the Lady
      Verena came forward, and with a heavenly smile she beckoned her son to
      approach the grating. There could be no thought here of any passionate
      outbreak, whether of sorrow or of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In whose sweet presence sorrow dares not lower<br /> Nor expectation rise<br />
      Too high for earth.&rdquo;&mdash;Christian Year.<br /> (Footnote in 1901 text.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The holy peace which had its abode within these walls would have found its
      way to a heart less tried and less purified than that which beat in
      Sintram&rsquo;s bosom. Shedding some placid tears, the son knelt before his
      mother, kissed her flowing garments through the grating, and felt as if in
      paradise, where every wish and every care is hushed. &ldquo;Beloved mother,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;let me become a holy man, as thou art a holy woman. Then I will
      betake myself to the cloister yonder; and perhaps I might one day be
      deemed worthy to be thy confessor, if illness or the weakness of old age
      should keep the good chaplain within the castle of Drontheim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a sweet, quietly happy life, my good child,&rdquo; replied the
      Lady Verena; &ldquo;but such is not thy vocation. Thou must remain a bold,
      powerful knight, and thou must spend the long life, which is almost always
      granted to us children of the North, in succouring the weak, in keeping
      down the lawless, and in yet another more bright and honourable employment
      which I hitherto rather honour than know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; said the knight, and he rose up full of self-
      devotion and firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my good son,&rdquo; said the Lady Verena. &ldquo;Ah! how many sweet calm joys
      spring up for us! See, already is our longing desire of meeting again
      satisfied, and thou wilt never more be so entirely estranged from me.
      Every week on this day thou wilt come back to me, and thou wilt relate
      what glorious deeds thou hast done, and take back with thee my advice and
      my blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not once more a good and happy child!&rdquo; cried Sintram joyously; &ldquo;only
      that the merciful God has given me in addition the strength of a man in
      body and spirit. Oh, how blessed is that son to whom it is allowed to
      gladden his mother&rsquo;s heart with the blossoms and the fruit of his life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus he left the quiet cloister&rsquo;s shade, joyful in spirit and richly laden
      with blessings, to enter on his noble career. He was not content with
      going about wherever there might be a rightful cause to defend or evil to
      avert; the gates of the now hospitable castle stood always open also to
      receive and shelter every stranger; and old Rolf, who was almost grown
      young again at the sight of his lord&rsquo;s excellence, was established as
      seneschal. The winter of Sintram&rsquo;s life set in bright and glorious, and it
      was only at times that he would sigh within himself and say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Montfaucon! ah, Gabrielle! if I could dare to hope that you have
      quite forgiven me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkChapter30" id="linkChapter30"></a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      CHAPTER 30
    </h3>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/sintram21.jpg" alt="sintram21" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The spring had come in its brightness to the northern lands, when one
      morning Sintram turned his horse homewards, after a successful encounter
      with one of the most formidable disturbers of the peace of his
      neighbourhood. His horsemen rode after him, singing as they went. As they
      drew near the castle, they heard the sound of joyous notes wound on the
      horn. &ldquo;Some welcome visitor must have arrived,&rdquo; said the knight; and he
      spurred his horse to a quicker pace over the dewy meadow. While still at
      some distance, they descried old Rolf, busily engaged in preparing a table
      for the morning meal, under the trees in front of the castle-gates. From
      all the turrets and battlements floated banners and flags in the fresh
      morning breeze: esquires were running to and fro in their gayest apparel.
      As soon as the good Rolf saw his master, he clapped his hands joyfully
      over his grey head, and hastened into the castle. Immediately the wide
      gates were thrown open; and Sintram, as he entered, was met by Rolf, whose
      eyes were filled with tears of joy while he pointed towards three noble
      forms that were following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men of high stature&mdash;one in extreme old age, the other grey-
      headed, and both remarkably alike&mdash;were leading between them a fair
      young boy, in a page&rsquo;s dress of blue velvet, richly embroidered with gold.
      The two old men wore the dark velvet dress of German burghers, and had
      massive gold chains and large shining medals hanging round their necks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sintram had never before seen his honoured guests, and yet he felt as if
      they were well known and valued friends. The very aged man reminded him of
      his dying father&rsquo;s words about the snow-covered mountains lighted up by
      the evening sun; and then he remembered, he could scarcely tell how, that
      he had heard Folko say that one of the highest mountains of that sort in
      his southern land was called the St. Gotthard. And at the same time, he
      knew that the old but yet vigorous man on the other side was named
      Rudlieb. But the boy who stood between them ah! Sintram&rsquo;s humility dared
      scarcely form a hope as to who he might be, however much his features, so
      noble and soft, called up two highly honoured images before his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the aged Gotthard Lenz, the king of old men, advanced with a solemn
      step, and said&mdash;&ldquo;This is the noble boy Engeltram of Montfaucon, the
      only son of the great baron; and his father and mother send him to you,
      Sir Sintram, knowing well your holy and glorious knightly career, that you
      may bring him up to all the honourable and valiant deeds of this northern
      land, and may make of him a Christian knight, like yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram threw himself from his horse. Engeltram of Montfaucon held the
      stirrup gracefully for him, checking the retainers, who pressed forward,
      with these words: &ldquo;I am the noblest born esquire of this knight, and the
      service nearest to his person belongs to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sintram knelt in silent prayer on the turf; then lifting up in his arms,
      towards the rising sun, the image of Folko and Gabrielle, he cried, &ldquo;With
      the help of God, my Engeltram, thou wilt become glorious as that sun, and
      thy course will be like his!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And old Rolf exclaimed, as he wept for joy, &ldquo;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy
      servant depart in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gotthard Lenz and Rudlieb were pressed to Sintram&rsquo;s heart; the chaplain of
      Drontheim, who just then came from Verena&rsquo;s cloister to bring a joyful
      greeting to her brave son, stretched out his hands to bless them all.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
